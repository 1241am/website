<p>Nokian Tyres of Finland had been making 80% of its tires in Russia, where energy was cheap, but after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the company lost billions and had to prioritize political security over business efficiency. They searched for a new factory site in Europe that was the right combination of real estate, transport links, labor supply and pro-business environment, and also had to be a member of both the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This shift in strategy highlights the changed global economic playing field, where assessments of political threats loom larger than before. C-suite executives are now recognizing the market's failure to accurately measure risk, and are altering their strategic investment plans accordingly.</details></p>

<p>Merk, a Russian soldier captured in eastern Ukraine, provided a rare account of the invasion of Ukraine from a Russian perspective in an interview with New York Times journalists. Merk had been imprisoned twice before, and was serving a two and a half year sentence when he was recruited by the Russian Ministry of Defense to join the Storm Z prisoner unit. He had little understanding of the war, and thought he was being sent to build houses. Merk's identity was verified through court documents and social media accounts, and his call sign was used to protect his identity. His interview provided insight into the Kremlin's efforts to sway public opinion, and the potential for ill-treatment of prisoners of war on both sides of the conflict.</details></p>

<p>This week, Israel withdrew from the West Bank city of Jenin after a large-scale incursion that left at least 12 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier dead. Thousands of Palestinians fled their homes in the wake of the operation, and a mass funeral was held for those killed. The violence has ratcheted up tensions in the region, with the most right-wing government in Israeli history in power and the Palestinian Authority increasingly losing control of hotbeds of militancy. In response to rocket fire from Gaza, Israeli fighter jets struck sites linked to Hamas, the Palestinian militant faction that controls Gaza. The Israeli Defense Forces said that all of the Palestinians who were killed were combatants, but the Palestinian authorities did not specify whether those who died were all combatants or included civilians.</details></p>

<p>In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, young Palestinians are writing farewell messages to their loved ones as violence intensifies. Amr Khamour, a 14-year-old teenager, wrote a message to his mother and father before he was killed by Israeli troops, asking for forgiveness and expressing his love for his childhood sweetheart. These farewells, known as "wills" in Arabic, reflect a prevailing sense among many young men that death is heroic, meaningful and inevitable. The violence has been particularly deadly for both Israelis and Palestinians, with at least 155 Palestinians and 29 Israelis killed this year. Palestinian society has long celebrated "martyrs" and farewell messages are often shared widely on social media, inspiring more young Palestinians to write their own. Many feel a duty to take on adult roles, including confronting Israeli troops, due to the generational trauma of living in the occupied territories.</details></p>

<p>Israel's most forceful incursion into the occupied West Bank in years has drawn to an end, with the military operation in the Jenin refugee camp leaving at least 12 Palestinians dead, one Israeli soldier dead, and thousands forced to flee their homes. The operation was described by Israeli officials as an effort to root out armed militants after months of growing violence, and was accompanied by intense drone strikes and 1,000 troops. The events have raised fears of an escalation of tit-for-tat violence, with more than 150 Palestinians killed over the past six months and 24 Israelis killed in Arab attacks. Images of the aftermath of the incursion show wrecked cars and damaged apartments in the refugee camp, as well as mass funerals for those killed in the clashes.</details></p>

<p>Andrew Ridgeley and George Michael, the heartthrob frontmen of the band Wham!, rose to pop stardom in the 1980s with their infectious bop "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go". Their modern mix of disco, funk, pop and soul in songs like "Young Guns (Go for It)", "Careless Whisper" and "Freedom" helped make them one of the biggest pop groups of the late 20th century. A new documentary, "Wham!", chronicles their short career, from their first video to their groundbreaking shows in China and their farewell concert in London. Ridgeley's mother kept 50 scrapbooks of photos, reviews and other ephemera, which provide a vivid portrait of the boys' friendship, and Ridgeley's contentment with their short career.</details></p>

<p>The new documentary "Wham!" follows the journey of George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley, two white boys from England of solid Greek Cypriot and Egyptian stock, as they take over a mini-block of 1980s culture with their duo, Wham! The movie dances past thorny questions of white people making Black stuff, and instead celebrates the duo's soul music that popped, synthesizing elements of Motown, disco, new wave, rap, Barry Manilow, Freddie Mercury, and Billy Joel. The film is adapted from scrapbooks kept by Ridgeley's mother, and features archival interviews, performance footage, outtakes, and music videos. Michael and Ridgeley narrate the film, and Michael's knack for tattoo melodies and chord progressions is highlighted. The movie ends with the duo's acrimony-free breakup in 1986, and provides a nostalgic, fantastical elixir of the early 1980s.</details></p>

<p>In December 2020, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) met to decide the presidential primary calendar for 2024.

This decision was made at the behest of the White House, who wanted to ensure that "voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee much earlier in the process". However, New Hampshire has declared that it will vote first regardless, setting up a potential clash between the DNC and President Biden, who could be embarrassed by a statewide defeat.</details></p>

<p>A federal judge in Louisiana has issued an order restricting the Biden administration from communicating with social media platforms about broad swaths of content online, a ruling that could have significant First Amendment implications. The order was a victory for Republicans who have accused social media sites of disproportionately taking down right-leaning content, and Democrats who say the platforms have failed to police misinformation and hateful speech. The ruling said that the government could not flag specific posts to the social media platforms or request reports about their efforts to take down content, but could still notify the platforms about posts detailing crimes, national security threats or foreign attempts to influence elections. This ruling is likely to be appealed by the Biden administration, and could force government officials to refrain from notifying the platforms of troublesome content.</details></p>

<p>This fall, Americans will be encouraged to get not just a flu shot, but also a Covid booster and, if they're older, a new vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (R.S.V.). Federal health officials have asked manufacturers to produce reformulated Covid vaccines, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed two new R.S.V. vaccines for older people. These three shots may help to reduce hospitalizations and deaths later this year, but there are uncertainties about how best to administer them and what the risks may be. The misery of the past winter may help to change minds, as the flu and Covid claimed tens of thousands of lives. Bundling all three inoculations into a single visit to a clinic or pharmacy is likely to encourage more people to get immunized, but there is a concern that vaccines may work against one another when administered simultaneously.</details></p>

Apps are now available to calculate the carbon footprint of landscapes, and the new wave of landscape design is reacting to the mid-20th century image of corporate campuses with velvety emerald carpets.

<p>The US federal debt is a long-standing issue, and while borrowing can be necessary in times of crisis, the current level of debt is unsustainable.

Both parties have expressed a need for change, but Republicans have continued to pass tax cuts that increase the debt, while Democrats have grown wary of calls to curtail spending.

<p>Germany is undergoing a shift in its foreign policy, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz taking steps to project the country beyond its usual European boundaries. This shift has been prompted by the war in Ukraine, and has seen Germany look for new partners, allies and markets in Asia, Africa and beyond. Germany has been warmly welcomed in many of these countries, but has had to confront the postcolonial resentment that exists in many of them, as well as its own history of colonialism and genocide in Namibia. This is forcing Germany to revisit its sense of self, and is proving to be quite a lesson.</details></p>

<p>The University of Virginia is one of many top public and private universities that enroll a strikingly affluent group of students, with less than 15% coming from families with incomes low enough to qualify for Pell Grants. Despite affirmative action, many colleges have failed to produce economic diversity, with more undergraduates coming from the top 1% of the income distribution than from the bottom 60%. However, some colleges have shown that it is possible to enroll and graduate more middle- and low-income students, while still maintaining racial diversity. Admissions officers have recognized that talented students from humble backgrounds may not look as polished, but have tremendous potential to change the trajectories of entire families.</details></p>

<p>On July 4, 2023, a shooter wearing a ski mask and body armor opened fire in the Kingsessing neighborhood of Philadelphia, killing five people and wounding two others. The shooter, using an assault-style rifle, fired seemingly at random, hitting a car carrying a family on their way home and those simply walking by. After a chase into an alley, a suspect was taken into custody and is being charged with more than 30 counts, including murder, attempted murder and assault. Witnesses said the volume and length of the barrage was striking, with 50 spent shell casings found at the crime scene.

<p>Sports heroes become transcendent when they are labeled the Greatest of All Time (GOAT). This term has become so pervasive in sports that it has been added to the dictionary, defined as "the most accomplished or successful individual in the history of a particular sport or category of performance or activity." While the term is often used to recognize athletes like Tom Brady, Serena Williams, and LeBron James, its overuse has led some to question its simplicity and lack of nuance. The term has a long history, from Muhammad Ali's "I Am the Greatest" poem to George Wagner's trash talk in the 1940s and '50s. Despite some wanting to ban the term, it has become a part of our collective consciousness.</details></p>

<p>Christina Quarles is a 38-year-old artist from Los Angeles who explores identity, race, gender, and sexuality in her paintings. Growing up with a Black father and white mother, Quarles experienced firsthand the difficulty of representing her identity. Her work is a combination of gestural brushstrokes, digital patterns, and vinyl stencils, creating a tension between the digital and the analogue. Quarles' paintings explore the idea of fragmentation and how it relates to identity, and how words can be inadequate when trying to express one's experience.</details></p></div></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/articles/2023-07-05-nytimes/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
