<h3>The Great Resignation:Gains for Workers or Employers? (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/business/economy/jobs-great-resignation.html">link</a>)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Millions of Americans changed jobs in the past two years due to worker power.</li>
<li>Voluntary quits rate has fallen sharply in recent months.</li>
<li>Wage growth has slowed, especially in low-paying service jobs.</li>
<li>Workers are becoming nervous about getting caught without a job in a recession.</li>
<li>Earnings gap between top and bottom income earners has begun to narrow.</li>
</ol>
 <details> 
   <summary>View More</summary>
<p>The past two years have seen a surge in job-switching, with workers demanding higher pay and employers often giving it to them. However, the rate of voluntary quits has recently fallen, and wage growth has slowed, especially in low-paying service jobs. This suggests that the pendulum may be swinging back towards employers. Despite this, some economists believe that workers will still hold onto some of the gains they made during the great resignation, as many of those who changed jobs did so to take better-paying ones or start businesses.</details></p>
<h3>Second Chances: Investing in Prison Education (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/business/economy/jobs-hiring-after-prison.html">link</a>)</h3>

<li>Prison education programs reduce recidivism and save money.</li>
<li>Biden administration dedicates $145 million to job training and re-entry services.</li>
</ol>
 <details> 
   <summary>View More</summary>
<p>Despite the U.S. unemployment rate hovering near lows unseen since the 1960s, over 60 percent of those leaving prison are unemployed a year later. This is due to a presumption that people with criminal records are more likely to be difficult, untrustworthy or unreliable employees. To address this, "second-chance hiring" has been pushed in corporate America, and many states have "ban the box" laws barring initial job applications from asking if candidates have a criminal history. The Biden administration has also announced $145 million over two years to job training and re-entry services for federal prisoners. These efforts show promise, as deeper investments in prison education have been found to stem recidivism, and for every dollar spent on prison education, the government saves $4 to $5 in reimprisonment costs.</details></p>

<p>The May Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report showed that job openings decreased from 10.3 million to 9.8 million, while the number of workers quitting their jobs increased. This suggests that the labor market is cooling but still has ample opportunities for workers. The June employment report, to be released on Friday, is expected to show a gain of 225,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 3.7%. Despite the cooling of the labor market, job openings remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels, indicating underlying strength.</details></p>

<p>NATO leaders had hoped to welcome Sweden as the alliance's newest member at their annual summit next week, but stalling by Hungary and objections from Turkey have made this nearly impossible. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg met with the foreign ministers and senior intelligence officials from Turkey, Sweden and Finland in Brussels in an effort to convince the Turks that Sweden has done enough to overcome their objections. The ball is now in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey's court, and if the summit ends with no agreement, it is unclear what would break the deadlock. President Biden has expressed his full support for Sweden's membership in NATO, but the decision rests in the hands of Mr. Erdogan.</details></p>

<p>Mayor Eric Adams has been called into question for his story of carrying a photo of fallen police officer Robert Venable in his wallet for decades. It was revealed that the photo was actually created by employees in the mayor's office in the days after he claimed to have been carrying it, and was made to look worn by splashing coffee on it. However, the mayor's spokesman insisted that Mr. Adams had carried the photo for decades, and provided the names of former transit police colleagues who said they had been friends. Despite the controversy, the mayor continues to share personal recollections to connect with his working-class base, though some of his stories have been difficult to verify.</details></p>

<p>The Earth is experiencing an unprecedented surge of heat, with global average temperatures reaching record highs in the last three days. This is due to a combination of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and the return of El Niño, a cyclical weather pattern. Heat waves have been seen in Texas, Mexico and India, while ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic are 2.9 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than usual. Other factors such as volcanic eruptions and sulfur pollution may also be playing a role in the heat surge. It is clear that the Earth is entering a multiyear period of exceptional warmth, with no sign of the heat letting up.</details></p>

<p>Residents of Hermosillo, Mexico, nicknamed the "city of sun" for its blistering weather, experienced a record high of 49.5°C (121°F) during a recent heatwave. The heatwave was caused by El Niño and an anticyclone, which prevented the formation of clouds and allowed radiation to hit directly. Land use also contributed to the heat, as urban sprawl prevents the cooling effect of forest cover. People in Hermosillo tried to cope with the heat by pouring water over themselves and seeking solace in nearby rivers. Authorities distributed water to the homeless and advised people to wear hats and loose clothes, as well as to avoid sun exposure. Despite the heat, life in Hermosillo continued as normal, with schools open and soccer games still scheduled to be played.</details></p>

<p>The United States has been working for decades to eliminate its stockpile of lethal chemical munitions, and this job is finally set to be completed by Friday. The weapons, which include nerve agents, mustard agents, and other deadly chemicals, were built to be fired, not disassembled, making the task of destruction exceptionally dangerous. The job has taken decades and cost close to $42 billion, but it is now almost finished. Craig Williams, who has been pushing for the safe destruction of the stockpile since 1984, said this is the first time an entire class of weapons of mass destruction will be destroyed.</details></p>

<p>Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen's four-day visit to China is intended to help stabilize the fraught relationship between the world's two largest economies. Yellen has expressed objections to China's record on human rights, called for diversifying American supply chains and acknowledged that protecting national security is paramount. During her visit, Yellen will need to defend export controls and tariffs while explaining that the United States does not aim to harm China's economy. She will also discuss issues of concern such as China's recent restrictions on the export of certain critical minerals used in the production of some chips, and potential limits on advanced chips and U.S. investment in the country. Yellen's visit is her most challenging test of economic diplomacy to date as she attempts to ease years of festering distrust between the two countries.</details></p>

<p>Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen, and other celebrities were among those who rushed to embrace the easy money and online hype of cryptocurrencies during the boom times.

Tom Brady, for example, was paid $30 million in FTX stock as part of an endorsement agreement, while his then-wife Gisele Bündchen was paid $18 million. Now, the former couple is being sued by a group of FTX customers, and they must pay taxes on at least some of their now worthless FTX stock.

<p>Delia and Mark Owens, an American couple, arrived in North Luangwa National Park in Zambia in the early 1990s to study lions and found elephant carcasses strewn across the park. They vowed to stop the slaughter and raised money to save the elephants. Bernard Mutondo, a hunter, was one of many poachers in the park and attempted to bring down the helicopter carrying the Owenses. Today, the Owenses' conservation program contends that the park is the most secure in Zambia. However, many Zambian villagers saw the Owenses as rich outsiders with an agenda centered on protecting animals from people who ate their meat and felt they had little choice but to accept. Despite the gulf of money and power between the Owenses and the villagers, the couple said they did what they could to help develop alternatives to poaching.</details></p>

<p>The federal government is set to award $6.88 billion to the construction of a second rail tunnel under the Hudson River to New York City, the most ever awarded to a mass-transit project. The two-tube tunnel is part of the Gateway infrastructure project, which is widely considered the most important in the country. The tunnel is urgently needed to replace the deteriorating single-track tunnels that opened in 1910 and were flooded with salt water in 2012. The federal pledge will allow Gateway’s planners to start seeking companies to construct a tunnel parallel to the deteriorating ones, a project that is expected to cost more than $16 billion before it is completed in 2035. The agreement between the governors of New York and New Jersey to an even split of the local share of the cost of building the tunnel was a critical precursor to obtaining federal funding. The pandemic has reduced the number of commuters, but analysts forecast that trans-Hudson travel demand is likely to be at or above pre-Covid levels by the time the new tunnel is completed. The tunnel is essential for the American economy, and officials are working to secure the remaining funding necessary to complete the project.</details></p>

His rhetoric is full of bloodthirstiness and he casts himself as a gladiator, inviting words like "most extreme", "horrifying" and "evil" as a measure of his mettle. DeSantis' lack of humility and trust in almost no one other than his wife, and his cold personality, raise questions about how he could possibly bring together and lead an entire diverse country.

<p>Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have had a strong relationship since Xi's ascension to power, with Xi referring to Putin as his "best, most intimate friend".

China has invested too much in the relationship to abandon it, but Xi is aware that a prolonged war in Ukraine could further threaten Putin and compromise his own foreign policy agenda. China is now looking to exercise its unique leverage over Moscow to urge an end to the fighting, as well as to seek better relations with Europe to prevent it from siding with the US against China.</details></p>

<p>The Democratic Party is currently debating the order of its presidential primaries, with President Biden and other top Democrats wanting South Carolina to go first. New Hampshire officials are fighting to keep their first-in-the-nation status, citing the benefits to the state. However, there is no evidence that New Hampshire’s voters have a better record of picking presidents than other Americans, and the state has only voted for the eventual Democratic president once in the past 50 years. If Biden does not appear on the ballot in New Hampshire, the state could theoretically damage his image and hurt his chances in the general election, though this scenario is unlikely.</details></p>

<p>On July 6, 2023, two firefighters tragically died while responding to a fire on a cargo ship docked at Port Newark, carrying over 1,000 vehicles. The fire spread quickly to two overhead decks, and the firefighters encountered unusual logistical challenges due to the ship's European-built firefighting equipment, which was not compatible with the larger 2.5-inch hose lines used by the Newark Fire Department. Three additional Newark firefighters were hospitalized with injuries, and two members of the Elizabeth Fire Department were hospitalized for smoke inhalation. The company expressed its condolences for the firefighters' families, and the mayor noted that they had not been trained for this type of fire.</details></p>

<p>Walt Nauta, a personal aide to former President Donald J. Trump, pleaded not guilty to federal charges of conspiring with Mr. Trump to obstruct the government’s efforts to retrieve a trove of highly sensitive national security documents. At a brief arraignment in Federal District Court in Miami, Stanley Woodward Jr., Mr. Nauta's lawyer, entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf. Mr. Nauta, a 40-year-old Navy veteran from Guam, is charged with Mr. Trump in a 38-count indictment with conspiracy, making false statements and withholding documents. The indictment alleges that Mr. Nauta moved boxes in and out of a storage room at Mar-a-Lago, the former president’s private club and residence in Florida, in an effort to obstruct the government's investigation. Mr. Nauta is now in the delicate position of being both the former president’s co-defendant and one of his most intimate employees.</details></p>

<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer and long-time vaccine skeptic, has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination. Despite the public scrutiny that accompanies a White House bid, Kennedy has continued to promote false and unproven claims, such as the scientifically discredited belief that childhood vaccines cause autism, the false notion that antidepressants are linked to school shootings, and the decades-old theory that the C.I.A. killed his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy. He has also falsely linked vaccines to various medical conditions, compared vaccine records to life in Germany during the Holocaust, and falsely told Louisiana lawmakers that the coronavirus vaccine was the “deadliest vaccine ever made.” Kennedy has also made baseless claims about a connection between gender dysphoria and chemical exposure.</details></p>

<p>Tamar-kali, a former punk rocker and composer, is premiering her new work "Sea Island Symphony: Red Rice, Cotton and Indigo" at Lincoln Center in Manhattan. The symphony is a four-movement programmatic piece that tells the story of the Gullah Geechee people from the Civil War to the rise of Robert Smalls, a Carolina man born into slavery who became a US Congressman in 1875. Tamar-kali's eclectic output is a product of her varied influences, from her family's juke joint in the Sea Islands, to blues and jazz, to Ashkenazi cantorial melodies and classical music. She has been a fixture on the New York music scene since the early 2000s, and her "Sea Island Symphony" is the culmination of her series "Freedom Is a Constant Struggle" which has included panel discussions about the complex and often neglected history of America's Black composers and classical music.</details></p></div></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/articles/2023-07-06-nytimes/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
