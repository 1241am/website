People are now using accusations of moral panics to delegitimize the opposition and their concerns. While moral panics are often exaggerated, they can still be rooted in legitimate issues, such as the feminist fight against pornography in the 1970s and 80s. The irony is that those accusing others of moral panics are often the most vocal moralizers themselves. This is exemplified by the case of the loudly homophobic politician caught having sex with another man in a bathroom.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A moral panic is the belief that some great wickedness is threatening society and must be stopped.</li>\n<li>Moral panics have been around since the Salem witch trials and have been increasing in number and changing in nature due to social media.</li>\n<li>Accusing someone of fomenting a moral panic has become a political tool to delegitimize the opposition.</li>\n<li>Moral panics often arise in response to a genuine issue, but the extent and significance of the problem is exaggerated.</li>\n<li>Those accusing others of moral panics are often the most proselytizing of moralizers themselves.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"A moral panic is like a wildfire, with its flames growing stronger and hotter as they are fed by the fuel of social media.
