Winston is an artist and photography program coordinator at Bard College who was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis at the age of 26. She has to travel 65 miles to receive monthly intravenous treatments, and has to be aware of her access to medical care in order to remain in remission. She uses her experience as a patient to reclaim her autonomy as an artist and photographer, and documents her illness and care every 28 days. She also reflects on her aunt who has progressive multiple sclerosis and does not have access to advanced imaging or treatments. She acknowledges the taboo of talking about being sick, and the precarity and inhumanity of health care access and costs in the United States. She emphasizes the importance of patient education and advocacy in order to maintain access to care in the current system.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Chronic illness is often hidden from society.</li>\n<li>Multiple sclerosis is a chronic illness characterized by flare-ups and periods of remission.</li>\n<li>Intravenous treatments are used to manage multiple sclerosis.</li>\n<li>Choices are determined by the need to maintain access to medical care.</li>\n<li>Patient education and advocacy are critical to managing chronic illness.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"Chronic illness is like a hidden river beneath the surface; Multiple Sclerosis is a tributary that ebbs and flows, requiring intravenous treatments to maintain its course; Choices are the dams that regulate the flow of care; Patient education and advocacy are the navigators that ensure the\"</p>\n<p>Chronic illness, MS, Treatment, Care, Autonomy, Politics</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/opinion/photography-multiple-sclerosis-chronic-care.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/opinion/photography-multiple-sclerosis-chronic-care.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 29, 2023","slug":"/living-with-chronic-illness-reflections-on-private-care-and-autonomy","title":"Living with Chronic Illness: Reflections on Private Care and Autonomy","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ff635fe6-e901-58a6-8a5e-a85a27d4c357","frontmatter__slug":"/living-with-chronic-illness-reflections-on-private-care-and-autonomy","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"living-with-chronic-illness-reflections-on-private-care-and-autonomy"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
