This has been observed by satellites that measure variations in Earth's gravity, and has been linked to a decrease in the amount of underground space that can hold water. Scientists have also found that the melting of polar ice sheets and mountain glaciers have changed the way mass is distributed around the planet, influencing its spin. This shift in the planet's axis has not been enough to affect the seasons, but it has had an effect on satellite-based navigation systems. The cause of these changes is linked to human activity, and further research is needed to understand the full extent of the effects.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Earth's rotation is not as smooth as it may appear.</li>\n<li>Around the turn of the millennium, Earth's spin started going off-kilter.</li>\n<li>Groundwater extraction has been identified as a factor influencing the drift of Earth's axis.</li>\n<li>Groundwater depletion has more than doubled since 1960.</li>\n<li>Human activity and the global climate are affecting the balance of mass around the planet.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It's like a spinning top; it may seem steady and balanced at first, but as the millennium turned, the spin began to wobble.
