This hum is likely the collective echo of pairs of supermassive black holes merging in the early universe. The signal was discovered by studying the behavior of rapidly spinning stars called pulsars, using a method that in 1993 earned two scientists the Nobel Prize in Physics. This hum is so loud that it could be coming from hundreds of thousands, or possibly a million, overlapping signals from the cosmic merger history of supermassive black hole binaries. The findings were consistent with Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, and could help researchers understand how the universe achieved its current structure and perhaps reveal exotic types of matter that may have existed shortly after the Big Bang.
