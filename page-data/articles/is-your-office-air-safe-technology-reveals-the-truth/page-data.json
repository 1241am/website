During the 2020 pandemic, the company installed sensors to track particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and carbon dioxide. The sensors provide employees with real-time data on air quality, allowing them to make informed decisions about their safety. The technology is also being used by clients to optimize energy use and attract tenants and employees. However, the technology is not a simple solution and there are still obstacles to improving indoor air quality, such as the nation's aging infrastructure and lack of regulation. Despite this, the technology is proving its worth in providing insight into air quality and allowing companies to make informed decisions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Companies are using technology to monitor indoor air quality.</li>\n<li>Indoor air-quality sensors can make invisible pollutants visible.</li>\n<li>Design and engineering firms are among the early adopters of the technology.</li>\n<li>Interest in the technology has been spurred by the pandemic.</li>\n<li>Challenges to improving indoor air quality include aging infrastructure and lack of regulation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It's like a doctor using a stethoscope to detect an invisible illness in a patient, while design and engineering firms are the early responders to the pandemic.
