At a Senate hearing in March, Attorney General Merrick Garland had assured Senator Charles E. Grassley that the investigation was insulated from political considerations. However, House Republicans released testimony from a senior I.R.S. investigator that appeared to contradict Mr. Garland’s assurances. The I.R.S. official, Gary Shapley, said that Mr. Weiss had been rebuffed by top federal prosecutors in Los Angeles and Washington when he had raised the prospect of pursuing charges against the President’s son in those jurisdictions. He also said that Mr. Weiss had been turned down when he sought special counsel status.The testimony has given Republicans a fresh opening to raise questions about the case and to cast doubt on the Justice Department’s repeated statements that Mr. Weiss had complete control of the investigation with no political interference. It remains unclear how much of the difference in the accounts reflects possible factors like miscommunication, clashing substantive judgments among agencies over how best to pursue a prosecution, or personal enmity among officials working on a high-pressure, high-profile case. Mr. Garland, Mr. Weiss, and Speaker Kevin McCarthy have all denied the claims made in the testimony. The investigation into Hunter Biden has been a source of contention between Republicans and Democrats, with Republicans trying to cast doubt on the Justice Department’s investigation and Democrats defending the investigation. It remains to be seen how the I.R.S. investigator’s testimony will affect the investigation and the political landscape surrounding it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Attorney General Merrick Garland and I.R.S. investigator Gary Shapley have provided differing accounts of the inquiry into President Biden's son, Hunter Biden.</li>\n<li>Republicans have been trying to cast doubt on the Justice Department's investigation of Hunter Biden under his father's administration.</li>\n<li>Senator Charles E.
