This crisis was recently highlighted by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, who was exiled after leading a 24-hour mutiny. His critiques of the military leadership were widely supported by soldiers, volunteers and the Telegram community, who agreed that the army was badly run and headed for defeat. The problems with the war go beyond the people involved and lie within the structure and culture of the Russian military. Reforms begun more than a decade ago were meant to create a smaller, leaner, more flexible army, but they failed to achieve the necessary flexibility to give decision-making power to commanders in the field. This month, the Ministry of Defense moved to assert control over the proliferating number of private military groups, but this action has not solved the underlying issues.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yevgeny V.
