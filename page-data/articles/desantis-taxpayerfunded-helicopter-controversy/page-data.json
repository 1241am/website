The Texas Department of Public Safety owns the 2008 Eurocopter, and ethics rules in Texas bar officials from using state resources in support of political campaigns. DeSantis' office suggested that he was visiting the border in a dual capacity, as both governor and presidential candidate, but his official schedule as governor omitted mention of it. Additionally, DeSantis took a boat tour of the Rio Grande as part of his visit, which was owned by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The Federal Election Commission requires candidates to reimburse federal, state or local government entities when using aircraft owned by them to campaign. DeSantis has previously faced accusations of blurring the lines between his official duties and his campaign.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ron DeSantis is the governor of Florida and is running for president.</li>\n<li>He was accused of inappropriately blurring the lines between his official duties and his presidential campaign.</li>\n<li>He used a Texas taxpayer-funded helicopter for a photo op.</li>\n<li>He also took a boat tour of the Rio Grande, which was owned by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.</li>\n<li>Federal campaign finance rules require candidates to reimburse federal, state or local government entities when using aircraft owned by them to campaign.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"Ron DeSantis is like a driver taking a joyride in a borrowed car, without asking permission or offering to pay for the gas.\"</p>\n<p>DeSantis, Texas Taxpayers, Helicopter, Campaign, Ethics</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/us/politics/desantis-texas-helicopter-finance.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/us/politics/desantis-texas-helicopter-finance.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/desantis-taxpayerfunded-helicopter-controversy","title":"DeSantis' Taxpayer-Funded Helicopter Controversy","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8a2a6159-4bb9-5447-bdc1-1eadf6d069d3","frontmatter__slug":"/desantis-taxpayerfunded-helicopter-controversy","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"desantis-taxpayerfunded-helicopter-controversy"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
