On Wednesday, debris and presumed human remains from the Titan were recovered and returned to land. The debris was unloaded at a Canadian Coast Guard pier in St. Johnâ€™s, Newfoundland and will be taken to a U.S. port for further analysis and testing. The Marine Board of Investigation will be looking for a point of failure of the hull, how pieces of carbon fiber and titanium were connected, and if any electronic data was recoverable. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada has inspected, documented and cataloged the wreckage of the Titan and turned it over to the U.S. Coast Guard. The investigation could take anywhere from 18 to 24 months.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Debris and presumed human remains from the Titan submersible have been recovered and returned to land.</li>\n<li>The debris will be taken to a U.S. port where the Marine Board of Investigation will do further analysis and testing.</li>\n<li>Investigators will be looking for a point of failure of the hull, how pieces of carbon fiber and titanium were connected, and if any electronic data was recoverable.</li>\n<li>The U.S. Coast Guard is leading the investigation into why the submersible imploded and is working with other national and international agencies.</li>\n<li>The Transportation Safety Board of Canada has inspected, documented, and cataloged the wreckage of the Titan and has finished its preliminary</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\" investigation.The debris and remains of the Titan submersible are like a jigsaw puzzle, and the U.S. Coast Guard is leading the investigation to put the pieces together and discover why it imploded.
