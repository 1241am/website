After an angry address to the nation, he met with his Security Council, with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu seated nearby. Putin then thanked the military for having “essentially stopped a civil war” in remarks broadcast on state media, standing on a stage dozens of feet away from the soldiers he addressed. He also spoke to Russian service members inside the Kremlin, combining the images of a modern president sitting workmanlike at his desk with the opulence and distance of Imperial Russia.The Kremlin's image machine sought to rewrite the story about what happened and assure the Russian public that Putin is still in control. The rebel's main rival, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, was at Putin's side at the Security Council meeting, showing that he remains in the president's favor. Putin's emphasis on loyalty to the state and his comparison of himself to Peter the Great, the 18th-century czar, sought to portray him as the dominant and most visible figure in Russia.The weekend's events, in which Wagner fighters breezed into a major city with armored vehicles and Mr. Prigozhin chatting with military officers in a command center he had just seized, showed that no one was in charge. Putin's televised speeches and triumphant imagery sought to portray him as the leader of Russia, and the one in control of the situation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Vladimir V.
