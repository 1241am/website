While the researchers were insistent that the dish portrayed in the fresco did not mean that the History of Pizza is about to be rewritten, they did allow that the flat, round dough topped with pomegranate, spices and what may have been a precursor of pesto might be “a distant ancestor to the modern dish.” The image is “pretty unique,” said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director general of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii.Though the origin of pizza is not without controversy, it may be virtually synonymous with Italian cuisine, and some like to point out that dough topped with herbs and cheese originated across the Ionian Sea, in ancient Greece. A recent study of the skeletons of some of the victims of the eruption of Vesuvius offered insights into the dietary habits of the ancient inhabitants of Herculaneum, but mystery remains as to what kind of cereals they ate, whether bread or pizza, and whether or not it was topped with something.It took centuries for pizza as we know it to make its way from ancient ovens to takeout boxes. To begin with, tomato sauce had to be invented — and that only happened after tomatoes were introduced to Italy following Columbus’s voyage to the new world. Despite this, the fresco found in Pompeii is a reminder of the long history of pizza, and the fact that it is still enjoyed today.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A fresco depicting what may be an ancestor of modern pizza was found in Pompeii, which was buried by a volcano in 79 A.D.</li>\n<li>The fresco showed a silver platter with a flat, round piece of dough topped with pomegranate, spices, and what may have been a precursor of pesto.</li>\n<li>The origin of pizza is controversial, with some claiming it originated in ancient Greece.</li>\n<li>Analysis of the skeletons of victims of the eruption of Vesuvius revealed they ate a lot of cereals, but it is not known if it was bread or pizza.</li>\n<li>It took centuries for pizza as we know it to make its way from ancient ovens to</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\" modern kitchens.Finding the fresco was like uncovering a time capsule of ancient pizza - a long-lost recipe from centuries ago, hidden beneath the ashes of Vesuvius.\"</p>\n<p>Pizza, Pompeii, Fresco, Xenia, Focaccia.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/world/europe/pizza-mural-pompeii.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/world/europe/pizza-mural-pompeii.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/pizzas-ancient-origins-2000-year-old-mystery","title":"Pizza's Ancient Origins: 2,000-Year-Old Mystery"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7d38ab53-928a-5dd3-a085-881efe111f2e","frontmatter__slug":"/pizzas-ancient-origins-2000-year-old-mystery","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"pizzas-ancient-origins-2000-year-old-mystery"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
