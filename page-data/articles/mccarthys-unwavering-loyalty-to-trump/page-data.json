Trump, despite not officially endorsing him for the 2024 presidential election. This was evidenced by his recent comments on CNBC, in which he suggested that Mr. Trump might not be the Republican presidential candidate best positioned to prevail in the 2024 election. This angered Mr. Trump’s allies, prompting Mr. McCarthy to quickly attempt to make amends by giving an exclusive interview to Breitbart News, in which he declared Mr. Trump the “strongest political opponent” against President Biden. He also called Mr. Trump to apologize, and has been advised by people like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich not to officially endorse him.Mr. McCarthy has been careful to keep his fragile majority together, and has allowed the House to become Mr. Trump’s instrument of revenge and retaliation at key moments. This includes his criticism of Manhattan district attorney Alvin L. Bragg before Mr. Trump was officially indicted in New York, and authorizing three of his committee chairmen to insert themselves into the criminal inquiry. Mr. McCarthy has also raged against the Justice Department for its investigation into Mr. Trump’s taxes.Overall, Mr. McCarthy’s comments and actions demonstrate his dependence on Mr. Trump, and his efforts to maintain the support of the former president and his allies. His relationship with the right-wing media ecosystem has also helped to insulate him from criticism from the hard right.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not officially endorsed former President Donald J.
