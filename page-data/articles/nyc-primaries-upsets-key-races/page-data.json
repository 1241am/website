Yusef Salaam, one of the Central Park 5, was leading by a commanding margin in the Democratic primary for a Harlem City Council seat, with his closest competitor, Assemblywoman Inez Dickens, conceding defeat. In East New York, Councilman Charles Barron was at risk of losing his seat to Democratic challenger Chris Banks, who had the support of labor groups. Incumbents easily held off primary challenges in Democratic primaries for district attorney in Queens and the Bronx. In New York City, just over 149,000 people had cast their ballots as of 6 p.m., including 44,611 votes that were cast during the nine-day early voting period.The district attorney races saw the incumbents of the Bronx and Queens both fend off challengers to win their respective Democratic primaries. In the Bronx, Darcel Clark defeated Tess Cohen, while in Queens, Melinda Katz defeated George Grasso and Devian Daniels. Ms. Clark and Ms. Katz both pointed to their focus on retail theft, gang takedowns and gun seizures as evidence of their commitment to justice.In the Central Harlem City Council race, Yusef Salaam was poised to win the contest among three candidates. Ranked-choice voting, where voters can rank up to five candidates in order of preference, was necessary in some races with more than two candidates, but not in the district attorney races. The outcome of the primaries will be determined in the coming weeks.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Primaries were contested Tuesday for a range of New York City Council seats, district attorneys in the Bronx and Queens, and offices throughout New York State.</li>\n<li>Yusef Salaam, one of the so-called Central Park 5, wrongfully convicted of the rape and assault of a female jogger, held a commanding lead over two Assembly members in the Democratic primary for a Harlem City Council seat.</li>\n<li>In East New York, Councilman Charles Barron trailed his Democratic challenger, Chris Banks, by three percentage points with 95 percent of votes counted.</li>\n<li>Ranked-choice voting was not be used in the races for district attorney.</li>\n<li>The incumbent district attorneys of the Bronx and Queens both f</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"ended off primary challengers.It was a busy Tuesday in New York, with a variety of races taking place from City Council seats to district attorneys.
