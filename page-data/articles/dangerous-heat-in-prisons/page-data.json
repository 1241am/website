Inmates have been struggling to survive in the extreme heat, relying on warm water, wet towels and fans to cool off. Desperate for help, some inmates have resorted to screaming in unison for water or for help with an inmate who had passed out. The Republican-controlled House proposed spending $545 million to install air-conditioning in the majority of state prisons that do not have it, but the bill to require cooling died in the State Senate. Despite a record surplus, the final state budget did not include money specifically for prison air-conditioning. The lack of action has been blamed on Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a conservative Republican who leads the Senate. The truth is the state is paying millions of dollars a year in heat-related lawsuits and the need for cooling facilities is becoming increasingly urgent.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The June heat wave in Texas has been particularly dangerous inside the state’s prisons, where inmates and guards have been struggling without air-conditioning.</li>\n<li>Inmates have been relying on warm water, wet towels and fans to cope with the heat.</li>\n<li>The Republican-controlled House proposed spending $545 million to install air-conditioning in the majority of state prisons that do not have it, but the bill died in the State Senate.</li>\n<li>State Representative Terry Canales has brought bills to address prison heat in each of the last two legislative sessions.</li>\n<li>The state is paying millions of dollars a year in heat-related lawsuits.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It's like a boiling pot of water with no lid - the inmates and guards are struggling to cope with the heat, while the Republican-controlled House proposed a lid to cover the pot, but the State Senate did not approve it.
