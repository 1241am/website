Critics of the move argue that it will disproportionately hurt students of color. The decision was made after the city was rocked by protests against law enforcement following the death of George Floyd in 2020. Since then, many cities have seen a reversal of the push to remove police officers from schools, as crime has surged and the nation has set a record for school shootings. The decision to bring officers back to Denver schools was driven by parents who mobilized after shootings this year. They argued that while policing results in disproportionate punishments for students of color, they were also being victimized disproportionately. Parents also cited lockdowns due to threats of violence that didn’t transpire as a source of trauma for their children. The role of school resource officers is complicated, as they serve not just as armed protectors, but also as counselors and disciplinarians. The debate over resource officers has been further complicated by the trial of Scot Peterson, the school resource officer in Parkland who failed to confront the gunman who killed 17 people in 2018. The trial has raised questions about the duty of campus officers during school violence.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Denver school leaders quickly removed police officers from campuses in the summer of 2020 in response to protests against law enforcement after the murder of George Floyd.</li>\n<li>The decision to bring officers back to Denver schools was driven by parents who mobilized after shootings this year.</li>\n<li>The presence of school resource officers results in disproportionate suspensions and arrests of Black and Latino students.</li>\n<li>The debate over resource officers comes after the nation set a record for school shootings in 2022.</li>\n<li>The role of school resource officers is complicated, serving not just as armed protectors, but also as counselors and disciplinarians.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It's like a tightrope walker trying to balance between two sides of a deep chasm.
