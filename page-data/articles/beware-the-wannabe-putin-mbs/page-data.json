He points out that M.B.S. has committed atrocities and is now demanding security guarantees from the United States and acceptance of a “civilian” Saudi nuclear program involving enrichment of uranium. Kristof believes this is a mistake and that the Biden administration should not be exchanging fist bumps with a Saudi ruler who governs tyrannically at home. He argues that just because M.B.S. has loosened social and cultural restrictions, it does not mean he should be trusted with a nuclear program. Kristof believes that the United States should not be fooled by M.B.S. and should not be making the same mistake they made with Putin.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Vladimir Putin has been courted by American leaders for decades, despite his provocations.</li>\n<li>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia is being courted by President Biden and his aides in a similar fashion.</li>\n<li>M.B.S. has been accused of kidnapping Lebanon's prime minister, starting a war with Yemen, and the murder and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist.</li>\n<li>The Biden administration is reportedly pursuing a deal in which the Saudis would recognize Israel in exchange for security guarantees from the United States and acceptance of a “civilian” Saudi nuclear program involving enrichment of uranium.</li>\n<li>Critics argue that the same mistakes made with Putin should not be repeated with M.B</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\".S.It's like trying to make a deal with a fox that has already raided the henhouse, when the same mistakes were made with a wolf in the past.\"</p>\n<p>Nicholas Kristof, Putin, M.B.S., Saudi Arabia, Nuclear Program, Diplomacy, Tyranny, Jamal Khashoggi, Iran, Ukraine, Social Reforms, Oil, Russia.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/opinion/putin-mbs-saudi-arabia-biden.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/opinion/putin-mbs-saudi-arabia-biden.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/beware-the-wannabe-putin-mbs","title":"Beware the Wannabe Putin: M.B.S.","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9c109caf-d964-58b4-99b4-9a2cac4b2f6f","frontmatter__slug":"/beware-the-wannabe-putin-mbs","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"beware-the-wannabe-putin-mbs"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
