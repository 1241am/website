Giuliani, the former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, was interviewed last week by federal prosecutors investigating the former presidentâ€™s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The voluntary interview, which took place under a proffer agreement, touched on some of the most important aspects of the investigation. This included a plan to create fake slates of pro-Trump electors in key swing states, the role played by John Eastman, and Sidney Powell's baseless claims about a cabal of foreign actors hacking into voting machines. Additionally, prosecutors asked Giuliani about a meeting at the Willard Hotel days before the attack on the Capitol. Shortly before the special counsel was appointed, the Justice Department issued a subpoena to Giuliani. This interview is a significant development in the investigation and indicates that the special counsel is actively seeking witnesses who might cooperate in the case.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rudolph W.
