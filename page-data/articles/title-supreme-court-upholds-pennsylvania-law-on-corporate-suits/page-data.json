The case was brought by Robert Mallory, a freight car mechanic who developed cancer after being exposed to toxic chemicals while working in Virginia and Ohio for Norfolk Southern Railway. The ruling allows Mallory to sue in a third state with no concrete connection to the suit. The decision was split 5 to 4, with Justice Neil M. Gorsuch writing for the majority and Justice Amy Coney Barrett writing in dissent.Justice Gorsuch rejected Norfolk Southern's argument that it was entitled to a more favorable rule, one shielding it from suits even its employees must answer. He explained that corporations have long pushed back against where claims against them may be heard and that Norfolk Southern has also promoted its business in Pennsylvania.The ruling may pave the way for other states to enact similar laws, giving injured consumers, workers and others more choices of where to sue and subjecting corporations to suits in courts they may view as hostile to business. The decision comes after the derailment of a Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals near the Pennsylvania state line, which amplified the stakes of the case.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Supreme Court upheld a Pennsylvania law that requires corporations to consent to being sued in its courts.</li>\n<li>The ruling may pave the way for other states to enact similar laws, giving injured consumers, workers and others more choices of where to sue.</li>\n<li>The Supreme Court was split 5 to 4, with Justice Neil M.
