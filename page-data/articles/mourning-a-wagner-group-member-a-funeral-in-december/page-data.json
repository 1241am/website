It looks at the work of Peter Pomerantsev, a British journalist born in the Soviet Union, and how his work on reality TV shows in Moscow gave him insight into Putin's Russia. The text also looks at the aborted mutiny of Yevgeny Prigozhin and how it punctured the cultivated unreality of Putin's Russia.The text explains how the Kremlin's spinmeisters work hard to promote an image of a virile and infallible president vanquishing devious foes. It also looks at how Putin has tried to sustain his monopoly on truth even as he demonopolized violence, allowing Prigozhinâ€™s Wagner group to fight in Ukraine as an autonomous unit. This created risks, including the risk that someone from one of those centers of power will be willing to tell an inconvenient truth.Prigozhin's diatribe on Telegram about the course of the war revealed the truth about the war and why it was started. This may be why he was treated as a hero in Rostov-on-Don. The text concludes by noting that this may be as close to the truth as Russians are soon likely to hear.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Peter Pomerantsev's book \"Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible\" provides insight into the psychology of modern Russia.</li>\n<li>Vladimir Putin seized Crimea in 2014 using \"little green men\" who may or may not have been Russian soldiers.</li>\n<li>The Kremlin works to promote an image of a virile and infallible president vanquishing devious foes.</li>\n<li>Yevgeny Prigozhin's aborted mutiny punctured the cultivated unreality and sinister surrealism of Putin's Russia.</li>\n<li>Putin's monopoly on truth can only be sustained through a monopoly on violence.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It is as if Putin has created a game of chess, where the pieces are all his own, the board is made of smoke, and the only way to win is by force.\"</p>\n<p>Russia, Ukraine, War, Monopoly, Lie</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/opinion/russia-putin-prigozhin-ukraine.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/opinion/russia-putin-prigozhin-ukraine.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/mourning-a-wagner-group-member-a-funeral-in-december","title":"Mourning a Wagner Group Member: A Funeral in December"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"df0bb141-642c-547a-be5a-6d3874e6bee8","frontmatter__slug":"/mourning-a-wagner-group-member-a-funeral-in-december","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"mourning-a-wagner-group-member-a-funeral-in-december"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
