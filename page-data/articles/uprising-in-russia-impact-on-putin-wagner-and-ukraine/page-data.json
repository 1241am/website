Prigozhin has been halted and the charges of \"armed mutiny\" have been dropped. Yevgeny V. Prigozhin is a billionaire and a onetime friend of President Vladimir V. Putin's. He was driven away from Rostov-on-Don, the southwestern Russian city, and is expected to go to Belarus under a deal announced by that country’s authoritarian leader, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko. It is not clear how his relations with Moscow — and with Mr. Putin — will evolve.The Wagner Group, a mercenary group that was advancing on Moscow, have been offered entry into Belarus and have returned to their camps in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region. It is unclear how quickly — or even whether — Russia’s military can absorb them into its ranks. It calls into question the willingness of Wagner fighters to serve and potentially die under the new, official structure.The Wagner Group operates in the Central African Republic, Mali and Sudan, and in each country it has offered military assistance in exchange for payment, partly in terms of access to the countries’ natural resources. In Mali, evidence suggests that they participated in a massacre of civilians last year. It remains to be seen how the events will affect the mercenary fighters, President Vladimir V. Putin and the war in Ukraine.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yevgeny V.
