Putin of Russia. The construction was first visible in satellite images taken on Monday by Planet Labs, a private company with a network of shoebox-size satellites. By Tuesday, the images showed that a sports field covering approximately eight acres within the gated military facility had been transformed, packed with at least six rows of what appear to be temporary structures, like large tents. The satellite imagery also shows similar construction in open areas next to the sports field. The base is about 80 miles from the Belarusian capital, Minsk, and about 13 miles northwest of the town of Asipovichy, which houses multiple military facilities, including a training ground and ammunition storage site. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus has stated that the Wagner fighters could be housed in an abandoned base with a fence, and the Asipovichy regional government has listed 31 buildings at the base in a real estate listing, including barracks, canteens and workshops. It is unclear when the Wagner fighters will leave Russia or the battlefield in Ukraine, or if or when they will travel to Belarus.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Satellite imagery shows rapid construction at a deserted military base in Belarus.</li>\n<li>The construction is likely for Wagner fighters who were given the option of relocating to the country after the group’s failed mutiny against President Vladimir V.
