This brings the total number of people charged in the case to six. The four men arrested this week are Riley Covarrubias-Ponce, Felipe Orduna-Torres, Luis Alberto Rivera-Leal, and Armando Gonzales-Ortega. They are accused of working together to bring people into the United States from Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico from December 2021 to June 2022. All four men are facing counts of conspiracy to transport and transportation of migrants illegally resulting in death, and of conspiracy to transport and transportation of migrants illegally resulting in serious injury. If convicted, each could face a maximum penalty of life in prison. The two other men charged in the case are Homero Zamorano Jr. and Christian Martinez. Mr. Zamorano's trial has already begun, and the other defendants are awaiting trial. The U.S. Attorney's Office said that the charges against Mr. Zamorano and Mr. Martinez carry a maximum penalty of life in prison or the death penalty, and that Attorney General Merrick B. Garland will decide whether to seek the death penalty at a later time.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Four men from Mexico have been arrested in connection with a human smuggling operation that left 53 people dead near San Antonio last year.</li>\n<li>The four men arrested this week are Riley Covarrubias-Ponce, Felipe Orduna-Torres, Luis Alberto Rivera-Leal, and Armando Gonzales-Ortega.</li>\n<li>The 53 migrants were found dead in and around an abandoned tractor-trailer on June 27, 2022.</li>\n<li>The four men arrested this week are charged with counts of conspiracy to transport and transportation of migrants illegally resulting in death, and of conspiracy to transport and transportation of migrants illegally resulting in serious injury.</li>\n<li>The maximum penalty for these</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\" crimes is life in prison.It is like four wolves hunting a herd of deer, leading to 53 casualties, and the wolves are apprehended and charged with murder and injury, facing a lifetime of punishment.\"</p>\n<p>Human Smuggling, Mexico, San Antonio, Arrests, Memorial, Migrants</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/texas-migrants-smuggling-deaths-arrests.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/texas-migrants-smuggling-deaths-arrests.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/four-men-charged-in-deadly-migrant-smuggling","title":"Four Men Charged in Deadly Migrant Smuggling"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"599e7ca5-ef9b-5163-8c32-4e610be99cbe","frontmatter__slug":"/four-men-charged-in-deadly-migrant-smuggling","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"four-men-charged-in-deadly-migrant-smuggling"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
