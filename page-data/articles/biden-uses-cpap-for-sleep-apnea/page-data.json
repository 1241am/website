The CPAP machine, also known as a continuous positive airway pressure machine, is one of the most widely used treatments for sleep apnea and works by delivering a continuous stream of air into masks worn during sleep, helping to keep breathing passages open and ensuring that people receive the oxygen they need. It is estimated that some 8 million people in the United States use CPAP machines and President Biden has had the condition for more than a decade. The White House official said that the president had begun wearing the CPAP device in recent weeks in an attempt to improve the quality of his sleep.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>President Biden has been using a CPAP machine to help treat his sleep apnea.</li>\n<li>Sleep apnea is a common disorder in which one’s breathing is interrupted as one sleeps.</li>\n<li>CPAP machines are the most widely used treatments for sleep apnea.</li>\n<li>Sleep apnea can bring with it a range of consequences such as lack of oxygen, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.</li>\n<li>President Biden had disclosed his sleep apnea more than a decade ago, but his presidential doctor did not mention the condition in either of the two letters assessing his health in 2021 and 2023.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It's like a person with a broken leg not wearing a cast - the broken leg will not heal properly and could lead to further complications, even though the treatment is known and available.\"</p>\n<p>Sleep Apnea, CPAP, Biden, White House, Health</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/us/politics/biden-cpap-sleep-apnea.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/us/politics/biden-cpap-sleep-apnea.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/biden-uses-cpap-for-sleep-apnea","title":" Biden Uses CPAP for Sleep Apnea","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"77dcd4d9-1763-52e9-bd14-ebad497161bc","frontmatter__slug":"/biden-uses-cpap-for-sleep-apnea","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"biden-uses-cpap-for-sleep-apnea"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
