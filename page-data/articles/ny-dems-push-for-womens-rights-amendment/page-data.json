The campaign is backed by Governor Kathy Hochul and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and is supported by numerous left-leaning groups. The effort is designed to increase voter turnout in 2024, when President Biden and House members will be up for re-election. The campaign plans to raise at least $20 million to spend on television ads, direct mail and organizing in support of the initiative. This is in response to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade last year and the Democrats' substandard performance in the midterm elections. The amendment is largely symbolic as New York already passed the Reproductive Health Act in 2019, which protected abortion rights in the state. The campaign hopes to maximize their efforts by bringing the amendment to a statewide vote in 2024, rather than this year.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Numerous left-leaning groups are behind a statewide effort to focus attention on a 2024 equal-rights referendum.</li>\n<li>The referendum seeks to explicitly bar New York from using its power and resources to penalize those who have abortions.</li>\n<li>The campaign plans to raise at least $20 million to spend on television ads, direct mail and organizing in support of the initiative.</li>\n<li>The campaign is designed to complement the House Democrats’ main super PAC’s $45 million bid to win six New York swing districts next year.</li>\n<li>The New York Equal Rights Amendment campaign is being supported by numerous left-leaning groups, including Planned Parenthood, the New York Immigration Coalition, the New York Civil Liberties Union,</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\" and the American Civil Liberties Union.It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle, with numerous left-leaning groups providing the pieces needed to complete the picture of a statewide effort to pass the New York Equal Rights Amendment in 2024, with $20 million to spend on advertising and organizing.\"</p>\n<p>Women's rights, Reproductive rights, Voter turnout, New York, Democrats, Equal Rights Amendment, Roe v.
