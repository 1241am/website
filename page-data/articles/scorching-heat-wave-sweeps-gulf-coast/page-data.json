More than 55 million people in the United States are under some form of heat advisory, watch or warning. In Austin, Texas, the heat index climbed to 118 degrees last week, the highest on record in the city. Ambulance calls and emergency-room visits for heat exhaustion have risen in Austin and other cities. This heat wave has already proven fatal for some, with a teenage boy and his stepfather dying while hiking in Big Bend National Park in Texas.The high temperatures are the result of a stubborn “heat dome” of high pressure that has lingered over much of Oklahoma, Texas and northern Mexico for days. Scientists have no doubt that heat waves around the world are becoming hotter, more frequent and longer lasting. The 2018 National Climate Assessment noted that the frequency of heat waves in the United States jumped to six a year by the 2010s, from an average of two a year in the 1960s.As people across the region seek to stay cool, demand for power from the state’s independent electrical grid has reached an unofficial high for June. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas has not reported any strain, but officials are still bracing for daily high temperatures to remain above 100 “for the foreseeable future.” Excessive heat could last in some parts of the region through the Fourth of July.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A heat wave is affecting much of Texas, Oklahoma, and the Gulf Coast, with dangerous heat forecasts reaching all the way to the Florida Keys.</li>\n<li>Ambulance calls and emergency-room visits for heat exhaustion have risen in many cities.</li>\n<li>The high temperatures have already proven fatal for some.</li>\n<li>The unusual early-summer temperatures are the result of a \"heat dome\" of high pressure that has lingered over much of Oklahoma, Texas and northern Mexico for days.</li>\n<li>Scientists have no doubt that heat waves around the world are becoming hotter, more frequent and longer lasting.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"The heat wave is like a giant inferno spreading across Texas, Oklahoma, and the Gulf Coast, baking the region with its relentless heat and causing serious health issues for those in its path.
