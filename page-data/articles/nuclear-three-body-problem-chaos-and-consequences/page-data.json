As Beijing rapidly expands its nuclear arsenal, the world of atomic superpowers is about to escalate to three from two, which could lead to global races for new armaments and even thermonuclear war. Experts say the tripolar age could put human survival at risk, but they also cite a number of three-body lessons from nature that could help reveal the military risks. Security-minded hawks want to expand the American arsenal, while doves see a window for three-body downsizing. The Biden administration has called for a further simplification, arguing that the American military has no need for arms that “outnumber the combined total of our competitors.”In everyday life, groups of twos and threes can seem inconsequential, but in many aspects of nature, threes have an almost magical power to sow chaos, to become more than the sum of their parts. Scientists call them nonlinearities, and the interval from two to three can produce a counterintuitive jump in complexity. This phenomenon is difficult to understand, and the world’s nuclear thinkers are finding the knotty topic to be as intractable as it was for Newton.The three-body problem is a complex issue that could have serious consequences for global security. While there is no clear answer yet, understanding the nonlinearities of three-body phenomena could help reveal the military risks and provide insight into how to move forward. It is important for the world’s nuclear thinkers to continue to explore this issue and find ways to ensure global stability.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The three-body problem is an issue of atomic experts and military planners.</li>\n<li>The three-body problem can lead to global races for new armaments and thermonuclear war.</li>\n<li>The three-body problem was first explored by Isaac Newton and was a source of frustration for him.</li>\n<li>The three-body problem can cause chaos and instability in groups of three.</li>\n<li>The Biden administration has called for a focus on the quality of nuclear arms rather than the quantity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"The three-body problem is like a game of tug-of-war: It can cause chaos and instability, and those who understand it best can gain an advantage.
