Voters are embracing more moderate candidates and are eager to see what his journey from convicted rapist to exonerated young man to advocate for criminal justice reform to elected official could mean for the future of Harlem. In East New York, voters have gone from supporting self-described socialists to backing moderate Democrats. Christopher Banks, the founder of an anti-poverty nonprofit, is leading Charles Barron, a self-described Black radical socialist, by just over 400 votes. The sentiment from voters is that they want change and are frustrated with the state of the district. Mr. Salaam's victory is seen as a shift in Black generational political leadership. His story is seen as the story of the residents of Harlem and they are eager to have someone with a new perspective in office.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yusef Salaam, a member of the Central Park 5, appears to be headed toward a City Council victory in Central Harlem.</li>\n<li>His victory and the likely defeat of Charles Barron in East New York signal a shift in Black generational political leadership.</li>\n<li>Voters in both Harlem and East New York appear to be embracing more moderate candidates.</li>\n<li>The issues in the City Council races are similar in both districts, including access to affordable housing and public safety.</li>\n<li>Yusef Salaam's story is seen as representative of the residents of Harlem, and his victory is seen as an opportunity for change.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It's like a new wave of leadership rolling in like a tide, with Yusef Salaam's victory in Harlem and Charles Barron's likely defeat in East New York.
