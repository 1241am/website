Mykyta Karagodin and his friends had just ordered their drinks and dinner when they heard a whistle and someone screamed \"Down on the floor!\" before the explosion. The blast wave threw diners and workers against walls, furniture and each other, battering and slicing them with shards of glass and other debris. The death toll from the attack had climbed to 11 people, including 14-year-old twin sisters and another teen. The restaurant had closed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in February last year, but reopened several months later. The attack showed the peril of trying to claim pieces of ordinary life during war. People rushed to the scene to search for their loved ones, while rescue workers worked to dig out the remains of the restaurant in search of victims or possible survivors. The tragedy of the attack serves as a reminder of the danger of living in a war-torn region.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At least 11 people were killed and 56 were wounded in a Russian missile strike on a restaurant in Kramatorsk, Ukraine.</li>\n<li>The attack occurred during the dinnertime rush, when the restaurant was bustling with people.</li>\n<li>The restaurant had closed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in February last year, but reopened several months later.</li>\n<li>Kramatorsk is located near the front lines of the war and is a frequent target of Russian missiles.</li>\n<li>Residents of Kramatorsk have been tempted to go about their normal daily lives, despite the danger of the war.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It was as if the restaurant was a peaceful oasis in a desert of war, but the missile strike was an unexpected sandstorm, leaving destruction in its wake.\"</p>\n<p>War, Destruction, Death, Kramatorsk, Ukraine,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/world/europe/ukraine-restaurant-russian-missile.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/world/europe/ukraine-restaurant-russian-missile.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/death-at-ria-lounge-a-tragic-night-out","title":"Death at Ria Lounge: A Tragic Night Out","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a2b0c3b5-a4a1-5966-92ca-631ef7fb1fa7","frontmatter__slug":"/death-at-ria-lounge-a-tragic-night-out","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"death-at-ria-lounge-a-tragic-night-out"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
