It is being played at sporting events, trendy bars and clubs, music festivals and private parties. The idea to play the song came after hearing it at restaurants and beach clubs in Mykonos and Ibiza. The song was written in 1918 by Abraham Zvi Idelsohn, a composer who believed the Jewish people needed new music at a time when Zionism and the push for a Jewish homeland were gaining strength. It became an instant informal hit and was adopted by Jewish youth groups. In the 1940s, Jewish people in the diaspora started singing it in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Harry Belafonte's recording of the song in the late 1950s made it even more mainstream and by the 1990s, European soccer teams were playing it in their stadiums. It has become a symbol of happiness, renewal and survival and is now being used to get people out of their seats and dancing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"Hava Nagila\" is a Jewish folk song that is over a century old.</li>\n<li>It is now played at secular, non-Jewish gatherings like sporting events, trendy bars and clubs, music festivals and private parties.</li>\n<li>The song was written in 1918 by Abraham Zvi Idelsohn, who wanted to create a melody that captured the spirit of the Jewish people.</li>\n<li>Harry Belafonte's recording of the song in the late 1950s made it more mainstream.</li>\n<li>It has become a symbol of happiness, renewal and survival for Jewish people in the diaspora.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"Hava Nagila is like a phoenix rising from the ashes of the past; it has been around for over a century, yet has been embraced by diverse cultures, gaining popularity with the help of Harry Belafonte.
