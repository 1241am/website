They searched for a new factory site in Europe that was the right combination of real estate, transport links, labor supply and pro-business environment, and also had to be a member of both the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This shift in strategy highlights the changed global economic playing field, where assessments of political threats loom larger than before. C-suite executives are now recognizing the market's failure to accurately measure risk, and are altering their strategic investment plans accordingly.</details></p>\n<h3>Merk's Story: A Russian Soldier's Account of Ukraine Invasion (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/world/europe/russia-ukraine-prisoner-interview.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Russian soldier (Merk) was captured in eastern Ukraine with little training.</li>\n<li>Merk provided rare account of Russian invasion of Ukraine.</li>\n<li>Merk was an inmate-turned-soldier in the Russian Army's Storm Z unit.</li>\n<li>Merk was offered a new life by the Russian Ministry of Defense.</li>\n<li>UN found ill-treatment of prisoners on both sides of the war.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>Merk, a Russian soldier captured in eastern Ukraine, provided a rare account of the invasion of Ukraine from a Russian perspective in an interview with New York Times journalists. Merk had been imprisoned twice before, and was serving a two and a half year sentence when he was recruited by the Russian Ministry of Defense to join the Storm Z prisoner unit. He had little understanding of the war, and thought he was being sent to build houses. Merk's identity was verified through court documents and social media accounts, and his call sign was used to protect his identity. His interview provided insight into the Kremlin's efforts to sway public opinion, and the potential for ill-treatment of prisoners of war on both sides of the conflict.</details></p>\n<h3>Rabbi Azman: A Hero of Ukraine (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/world/europe/rabbi-ukraine-viral-russia.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman is the chief rabbi of Ukraine.</li>\n<li>He has been involved in humanitarian efforts since Russia's full-scale invasion.</li>\n<li>He has been honored nationally for his work.</li>\n<li>He has a longstanding relationship with Rudolph W.

Thousands of Palestinians fled their homes in the wake of the operation, and a mass funeral was held for those killed. The violence has ratcheted up tensions in the region, with the most right-wing government in Israeli history in power and the Palestinian Authority increasingly losing control of hotbeds of militancy. In response to rocket fire from Gaza, Israeli fighter jets struck sites linked to Hamas, the Palestinian militant faction that controls Gaza. The Israeli Defense Forces said that all of the Palestinians who were killed were combatants, but the Palestinian authorities did not specify whether those who died were all combatants or included civilians.</details></p>\n<h3>Farewells in Occupied Territories (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/world/middleeast/young-palestinians-west-bank.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>155 Palestinians killed in 2021 due to Israeli military raids and attacks.</li>\n<li>29 Israelis killed by Palestinian assailants in 2021.</li>\n<li>Young Palestinians writing farewell messages to loved ones.</li>\n<li>Palestinian society lionizes \"martyrs\" killed by Israeli forces.</li>\n<li>Farewell messages shared widely on social media.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, young Palestinians are writing farewell messages to their loved ones as violence intensifies. Amr Khamour, a 14-year-old teenager, wrote a message to his mother and father before he was killed by Israeli troops, asking for forgiveness and expressing his love for his childhood sweetheart. These farewells, known as \"wills\" in Arabic, reflect a prevailing sense among many young men that death is heroic, meaningful and inevitable. The violence has been particularly deadly for both Israelis and Palestinians, with at least 155 Palestinians and 29 Israelis killed this year. Palestinian society has long celebrated \"martyrs\" and farewell messages are often shared widely on social media, inspiring more young Palestinians to write their own. Many feel a duty to take on adult roles, including confronting Israeli troops, due to the generational trauma of living in the occupied territories.</details></p>\n<h3>End of Israeli Incursion in Jenin (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/world/europe/israel-raid-jenin-photos.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Israel carried out a major incursion into the West Bank city of Jenin.</li>\n<li>The operation killed at least 12 Palestinians and left one Israeli soldier dead.</li>\n<li>The incursion was aimed at rooting out armed militants after months of violence.</li>\n<li>Tensions escalated after 8 Israelis were injured in a car-ramming and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv.</li>\n<li>This year has been one of the deadliest for Palestinians and Israelis in years.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>Israel's most forceful incursion into the occupied West Bank in years has drawn to an end, with the military operation in the Jenin refugee camp leaving at least 12 Palestinians dead, one Israeli soldier dead, and thousands forced to flee their homes. The operation was described by Israeli officials as an effort to root out armed militants after months of growing violence, and was accompanied by intense drone strikes and 1,000 troops. The events have raised fears of an escalation of tit-for-tat violence, with more than 150 Palestinians killed over the past six months and 24 Israelis killed in Arab attacks. Images of the aftermath of the incursion show wrecked cars and damaged apartments in the refugee camp, as well as mass funerals for those killed in the clashes.</details></p>\n<h3>Khalif Cooper: A Reminder of America's Policing Crisis (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/nyregion/paterson-shooting-paralyzed.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Khalif Cooper was shot by a police officer in Paterson, NJ.</li>\n<li>He was paralyzed from the waist down and lost a kidney and half his colon.</li>\n<li>Officer Moravek was charged with aggravated assault for shooting without warning.</li>\n<li>Khalif Cooper filed a $50 million lawsuit against Officer Moravek and the City of Paterson.</li>\n<li>The lawsuit aims to provide lifetime medical care and to hold bad cops accountable.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>Khalif Cooper, a 29-year-old Black man, was shot by a police officer in Paterson, NJ, and was left paralyzed from the waist down. He lost a kidney, half his colon, and his ability to walk. He was running away from the sound of gunfire when he was shot, and a gun found nearby had none of his DNA or fingerprints. He has filed a $50 million lawsuit against the officer, the city, and its former police chief and police director, hoping to ensure enough money for a lifetime of medical care and to show the consequences of bad policing decisions. His story is a reminder of the policing crisis in America.</details></p>\n<h3>Wham!

Their modern mix of disco, funk, pop and soul in songs like \"Young Guns (Go for It)\", \"Careless Whisper\" and \"Freedom\" helped make them one of the biggest pop groups of the late 20th century. A new documentary, \"Wham!\", chronicles their short career, from their first video to their groundbreaking shows in China and their farewell concert in London. Ridgeley's mother kept 50 scrapbooks of photos, reviews and other ephemera, which provide a vivid portrait of the boys' friendship, and Ridgeley's contentment with their short career.</details></p>\n<h3>Wham!

The movie dances past thorny questions of white people making Black stuff, and instead celebrates the duo's soul music that popped, synthesizing elements of Motown, disco, new wave, rap, Barry Manilow, Freddie Mercury, and Billy Joel. The film is adapted from scrapbooks kept by Ridgeley's mother, and features archival interviews, performance footage, outtakes, and music videos. Michael and Ridgeley narrate the film, and Michael's knack for tattoo melodies and chord progressions is highlighted. The movie ends with the duo's acrimony-free breakup in 1986, and provides a nostalgic, fantastical elixir of the early 1980s.</details></p>\n<h3>DNC, White House At Odds Over 2024 Primary Calendar (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/magazine/democratic-national-committee-2024.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>White House wanted South Carolina to vote first in 2024.</li>\n<li>D.N.C. granted waivers to Rule 12-A for South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Nevada.</li>\n<li>Iowa caucuses retired due to 2020 issues.</li>\n<li>New Hampshire declared to vote first anyway.</li>\n<li>D.N.C. formally endorsed Biden.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>In December 2020, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) met to decide the presidential primary calendar for 2024. After months of debate, it was decided that South Carolina would vote first, followed by New Hampshire, Nevada and Georgia. This decision was made at the behest of the White House, who wanted to ensure that \"voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee much earlier in the process\". However, New Hampshire has declared that it will vote first regardless, setting up a potential clash between the DNC and President Biden, who could be embarrassed by a statewide defeat.</details></p>\n<h3>Ruling Restricts Biden Admin From Social Media Platforms (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/business/federal-judge-biden-social-media.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Federal judge in Louisiana restricts Biden administration from communicating with social media platforms.</li>\n<li>Restriction could curtail efforts to combat false and misleading narratives.</li>\n<li>Republicans accuse social media sites of taking down right-leaning content.</li>\n<li>Judge Doughty said government can still notify platforms of posts detailing crimes.</li>\n<li>Justice Department reviewing ruling and evaluating next steps.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>A federal judge in Louisiana has issued an order restricting the Biden administration from communicating with social media platforms about broad swaths of content online, a ruling that could have significant First Amendment implications. The order was a victory for Republicans who have accused social media sites of disproportionately taking down right-leaning content, and Democrats who say the platforms have failed to police misinformation and hateful speech. The ruling said that the government could not flag specific posts to the social media platforms or request reports about their efforts to take down content, but could still notify the platforms about posts detailing crimes, national security threats or foreign attempts to influence elections. This ruling is likely to be appealed by the Biden administration, and could force government officials to refrain from notifying the platforms of troublesome content.</details></p>\n<h3>Controlling Inflation: A Global Challenge (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/business/economy/inflation-global.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Inflation is rising too fast in many economies.</li>\n<li>Central bankers are raising interest rates to try to control inflation.</li>\n<li>If inflation persists, it could cause a major recession.</li>\n<li>Central banks are focused on fighting high inflation.</li>\n<li>Many central banks are raising rates to try to bring inflation down.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>Inflation is a global issue, with many major economies struggling to keep prices under control. Central banks have raised interest rates in an attempt to slow their economies and bring inflation down, but the process is proving difficult. Policymakers across the world are trying to balance the need to bring inflation down without causing too much damage to their economies, as higher and less predictable inflation could lead to a major recession. The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Reserve Bank of Australia, and Norges Bank have all raised their policy rates in an effort to combat inflation.</details></p>\n<h3>Financial Trauma: Causes, Signs &#x26; Management (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/business/financial-trauma-spending-debt.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Financial trauma is an intense and enduring emotional response to current or past financial distress.</li>\n<li>Common causes of financial trauma include medical debt, financial insecurity and an economic crisis.</li>\n<li>Financial trauma can cause negative thoughts, flashbacks and anxiety.</li>\n<li>Avoidance of money is a telltale sign of financial trauma.</li>\n<li>Overspending can also be evidence of financial trauma.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>Financial trauma is an intense and enduring emotional response to current or past financial distress, which can cause negative thoughts, flashbacks and anxiety. Common causes include medical debt, financial insecurity and an economic crisis, and it can travel through generations in different ways. Symptoms of financial trauma include money avoidance, negative thoughts and overspending, and it can hinder people's savings and cause debt.

Federal health officials have asked manufacturers to produce reformulated Covid vaccines, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed two new R.S.V. vaccines for older people. These three shots may help to reduce hospitalizations and deaths later this year, but there are uncertainties about how best to administer them and what the risks may be. The misery of the past winter may help to change minds, as the flu and Covid claimed tens of thousands of lives. Bundling all three inoculations into a single visit to a clinic or pharmacy is likely to encourage more people to get immunized, but there is a concern that vaccines may work against one another when administered simultaneously.</details></p>\n<h3>Triple Vaccines: Protect Against Tripledemic (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/health/flu-covid-rsv-vaccines.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Everyone 6 months and older should get the flu vaccine.</li>\n<li>Covid shots are designed to target XBB.1.5 variant.</li>\n<li>R.S.V. vaccine not approved for under 60s.</li>\n<li>Covid vaccine should be taken annually.</li>\n<li>R.S.V. vaccine recommended for 60+ after consulting doctor.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>This fall, Americans should get the flu, Covid and R.S.V. vaccines to protect against the potential \"tripledemic\" of respiratory illnesses. All three vaccines should be available for free for those with insurance. The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months and older, while the Covid vaccine is designed for those with the XBB.1.5 variant. The R.S.V. vaccine is not approved for those under 60, and the C.D.C. recommends those 60 and over consult with their doctor before getting the shot. The exact timing of the vaccines is unknown, but experts recommend getting them as soon as possible.</details></p>\n<h3>De Blasio-McCray Split: A Lesson for All (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/nyregion/de-blasio-marriage-chirlane-mccray.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Bill de Blasio and Chirlane McCray announced they are separating but not divorcing.</li>\n<li>They plan to date other people and continue to share their Brooklyn home.</li>\n<li>Their marriage helped fuel his campaign for mayor of New York.</li>\n<li>They are not planning to divorce and will continue to share their Park Slope townhouse.</li>\n<li>Their separation is imbued with civic resonance due to their mixed-race symbolism.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>Bill de Blasio and Chirlane McCray, who married in 1994, recently announced that they are separating and plan to date other people. Their marriage helped fuel his campaign for mayor of New York and their intense personal and political bond drew admiration and scrutiny. After a discussion about their relationship, they decided to part ways and remain living together in their Park Slope townhouse. They believe that if de Blasio had never been mayor, their marriage would not have reached this point. They hope that their story can be a lesson to other couples, both those in the public eye and those not, to communicate openly and honestly about their needs and feelings.</details></p>\n<h3>The Greening of Corporate Landscapes (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/business/corporate-landscaping-native-plants.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Companies are replacing manicured lawns with native plants.</li>\n<li>Native plants require less maintenance and are better for the environment.</li>\n<li>Corporate sustainability programs encompass the land the buildings sit on.</li>\n<li>Apps calculate the carbon footprint of landscapes.</li>\n<li>The shift in landscaping requires a mind-set shift.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>Air Products recently shifted from manicured lawns and boxwood hedges to native plants at its new headquarters in Allentown, Pennsylvania. This shift is being driven by a growing awareness of the environmental costs of installing and maintaining lawns, and is being mirrored in public parks, university campuses, and homeowners' backyards. Apps are now available to calculate the carbon footprint of landscapes, and the new wave of landscape design is reacting to the mid-20th century image of corporate campuses with velvety emerald carpets. Native plants are now being used to provide food and habitat for endangered birds, bees, and butterflies, and to reduce the need for watering, weed killing, mowing, and blowing.</details></p>\n<h3>Reducing US Federal Debt: A New Path (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/opinion/debt-crisis.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists.</li>\n<li>Borrowing and spending are necessary to stimulate the economy.</li>\n<li>US borrows heavily during periods of economic growth.</li>\n<li>Interest payments to investors are increasing.</li>\n<li>Both parties need to make larger changes to reduce the debt.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>The US federal debt is a long-standing issue, and while borrowing can be necessary in times of crisis, the current level of debt is unsustainable. Interest payments are consuming an increasing amount of the nation's resources, and the recent deal to raise the debt ceiling did not make meaningful progress. Both parties have expressed a need for change, but Republicans have continued to pass tax cuts that increase the debt, while Democrats have grown wary of calls to curtail spending. It is imperative for the nation's leaders to chart a new course to reduce the debt and ensure the nation's resources are used for the benefit of the American people.</details></p>\n<h3>Democrats Ready for Big 2024 Win (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/opinion/biden-trump-2024.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>White people without college degrees decreased by 2.1 million from 2016 to 2022.</li>\n<li>Trump's false claim of election fraud has had continuing ramifications.</li>\n<li>Republicans reward politicians who perpetuate the lie.</li>\n<li>Democrats have an edge in the fight for Electoral College majority.</li>\n<li>Republican advantages include high rates of crime and homelessness.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>The number of white people without college degrees, the core of Donald Trump's support, has decreased by 2.1 million from 2016 to 2022, while the number of white people with college degrees, an increasingly Democratic constituency, has grown by 13.3 million. Trump's false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him has had continuing ramifications, with a significant rise in support for violent political activism among Democrats. Republicans are rewarded for endorsing the lie, and Democrats have an initial edge in the fight for an Electoral College majority. Despite Republican advantages, Democratic strategists Celinda Lake and Mike Lux have declared that all the elements are in place for a big Democratic victory in 2024.</details></p>\n<h3>Germany's New Foreign Policy: A Lesson in Self-Reflection (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/opinion/germany-africa-west.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Germany is paying proper attention to the rest of the world.</li>\n<li>Germany's efforts to reconcile with the nations that suffered most from Nazi terror.</li>\n<li>Germany is being forced to revisit its sense of self.</li>\n<li>Germany has begun to look for new partners, allies and markets.</li>\n<li>Germany is seen as part of the colonizing West.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>Germany is undergoing a shift in its foreign policy, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz taking steps to project the country beyond its usual European boundaries. This shift has been prompted by the war in Ukraine, and has seen Germany look for new partners, allies and markets in Asia, Africa and beyond. Germany has been warmly welcomed in many of these countries, but has had to confront the postcolonial resentment that exists in many of them, as well as its own history of colonialism and genocide in Namibia. This is forcing Germany to revisit its sense of self, and is proving to be quite a lesson.</details></p>\n<h3>Unlocking Potential: Economic Diversity in Higher Education (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/briefing/affirmative-action.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Less than 15% of UVA undergraduates come from low-income families.</li>\n<li>Elite private colleges also have skewed affluent enrollments.</li>\n<li>Affirmative action has not changed economic diversity.</li>\n<li>Economic diversity matters for its own sake.</li>\n<li>Colleges have shown it's possible to enroll more low-income students.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>The University of Virginia is one of many top public and private universities that enroll a strikingly affluent group of students, with less than 15% coming from families with incomes low enough to qualify for Pell Grants. Despite affirmative action, many colleges have failed to produce economic diversity, with more undergraduates coming from the top 1% of the income distribution than from the bottom 60%. However, some colleges have shown that it is possible to enroll and graduate more middle- and low-income students, while still maintaining racial diversity. Admissions officers have recognized that talented students from humble backgrounds may not look as polished, but have tremendous potential to change the trajectories of entire families.</details></p>\n<h3>Grenada Built to Win: A Haven of Hope for Edenwald Houses (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/nyregion/edenwald-bronx-basketball.html\">link</a>)</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Rasheem Jenkins founded Grenada Built to Win summer basketball league in Edenwald Houses.</li>\n<li>Basketball gave Jenkins an escape from the projects.</li>\n<li>The league is in its 11th season and provides activities to the youth.</li>\n<li>The 47th Police Precinct in the northeast Bronx recorded 2,127 major felony offenses in 2012.</li>\n<li>The league was founded to provide more opportunities to the kids.</li>\n</ol>\n <details> \n   <summary>View More</summary>\n<p>Rasheem Jenkins and Vance Callahan grew up playing basketball on the streets of Edenwald Houses in the Bronx.
