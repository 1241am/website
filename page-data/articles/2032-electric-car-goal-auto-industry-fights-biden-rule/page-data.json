This rule would eliminate about seven billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and is one of the strongest actions taken by any country to fight climate change. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing 42 car companies, has stated that the proposed rules are “neither reasonable nor achievable” and would increase the cost of vehicles, reduce consumer choice, and disadvantage major portions of the United States population and territory.</p>\n<p>The proposed new car pollution regulation is one of the Biden administration’s strongest weapons to fight climate change, as emissions from vehicle tailpipes are the largest source of climate-warming pollution in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of soliciting public comments ahead of finalizing and implementing the rule by the first half of next year. The auto companies’ concerns are expected to influence the final rule, particularly as Mr. Biden campaigns for re-election in politically critical auto-making states like Michigan and Ohio. This pushback is the latest in a yearslong back-and-forth between Washington and the auto industry over climate pollution.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The auto industry’s largest lobbying organization has come out against the Biden administration’s proposed rule to ensure two-thirds of new passenger cars sold in the US are all-electric by 2032.</li>\n<li>The proposed rule would eliminate about seven billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</li>\n<li>The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing 42 car companies, believes the proposed rules are “neither reasonable nor achievable in the time frame covered in this proposal.”</li>\n<li>The proposed new car pollution regulation would be one of the Biden administration’s strongest weapons to fight climate change.</li>\n<li>The Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of soliciting public comments ahead</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\" of the rule’s implementation.It is as if a marathon runner is preparing to run a race to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but the largest team of supporters is telling them the goal is too ambitious and unrealistic to achieve in the given time frame.\"</p>\n<p>Auto industry, Climate change, Biden administration, Electric vehicles, Carbon dioxide, Internal combustion, Alliance for Automotive Innovation, EPA, Fuel-economy standards, Obama-era rules, Trump administration, Global economic crisis, Tax incentives, Heat waves, Flooding, Drought, Crop failures, Species extinction</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/climate/epa-electric-cars-auto-industry-criticism.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/climate/epa-electric-cars-auto-industry-criticism.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/2032-electric-car-goal-auto-industry-fights-biden-rule","title":"2032 Electric Car Goal: Auto Industry Fights Biden Rule","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ce1b6058-6f7e-514a-a173-f5b08485c4ca","frontmatter__slug":"/2032-electric-car-goal-auto-industry-fights-biden-rule","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"2032-electric-car-goal-auto-industry-fights-biden-rule"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
