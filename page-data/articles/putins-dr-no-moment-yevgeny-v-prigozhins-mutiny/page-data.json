Prigozhin and his attempted mutiny. Prigozhin led a convoy of ex-convicts and mercenaries towards Moscow, but called off the revolution when he realized his convoy would be vulnerable to an air attack. Putin threatened to \"squash him like a bug,\" and the President of Belarus negotiated a plea bargain. The text then goes on to discuss the balance of power between Putin and Biden, and how Biden has been exposing Putin's weaknesses.The text suggests that Putin has long ruled with fear and money, but that fear may have left the building in Moscow. With Putin's aura of invincibility having taken a hit, others may soon challenge him. The text also suggests that Biden has been successful in confronting Putin in Ukraine and exposing his weaknesses.The text concludes by suggesting that if Prigozhin or his allies were in Putin's position, they would stay away from anyone walking along a Belarusian sidewalk with an umbrella when the sun is shining. This is a reference to a classic Bond movie scene, and implies that Putin is still a powerful figure, and that his enemies should still be cautious.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Vladimir Putin's ex-chef/ex-cyberhacker/recent mercenary army leader, Yevgeny V.
