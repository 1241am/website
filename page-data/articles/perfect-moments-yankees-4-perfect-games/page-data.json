This feat has only been accomplished 24 times in major league history, and the Yankees are responsible for four of them. Germán had never pitched a shutout in his 13 professional seasons and had only one complete game in the minors in 2017. He was booed off the mound in his last start for the Yankees, and had spent part of May serving a suspension after umpires in Toronto found a sticky substance on his pitching hand. He also served a much more serious suspension, for domestic violence, from mid-September 2019 through the shortened 2020 season that followed. Despite all of this, Germán was able to achieve perfection on the mound. He faced only 27 batters, and none of them reached base. The Yankees’ four perfect games are the most by any franchise, breaking their tie with the White Sox. A perfect game is a reminder that perfection might actually be out there, waiting to surprise us — whoever we are. It is a feat that requires a combination of skill, luck, and hard work, and Germán is a testament to that.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don Larsen and Domingo Germán are the only two Yankees to have thrown perfect games.</li>\n<li>Perfect games are rare, with only 24 having been thrown in major league history.</li>\n<li>Perfect games can happen to any pitcher at any time, regardless of their skill level.</li>\n<li>The Oakland Athletics have had two perfect games thrown against them, one by Catfish Hunter and one by Dallas Braden.</li>\n<li>Perfect games require luck, skill, and a lot of hard work to achieve.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"Don Larsen and Domingo Germán are like two rare diamonds in a sea of coal: hard to find, but not impossible.
