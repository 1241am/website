The judge said the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their challenge to the law on constitutional grounds. The law, known as Senate Bill 150, was passed in March and included numerous restrictions on the lives of transgender minors, such as prohibiting doctors from providing gender transition surgery, forbidding transgender students from using bathrooms that align with their gender identities, and banning lessons about gender identity or sexual orientation in schools. The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky filed a lawsuit on behalf of seven transgender children and their parents in May, and the judge's ruling was a victory for transgender-rights advocates. This is part of a national wave of laws passed by Republican legislators recently that zero in on issues of gender and identity, and court challenges to the bans have been brought in several states. When judges have weighed in, it has frequently been on the side of transgender-rights advocates.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A federal judge temporarily blocked part of a Kentucky state law from taking effect that would ban the prescription and administration of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender people younger than 18.</li>\n<li>The law prohibits doctors in Kentucky from providing gender transition surgery or administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy to people under 18.</li>\n<li>It also prohibits school districts from requiring or recommending that any student be referred to by a pronoun that “does not conform to a student’s biological sex,” and it forbids transgender students from using bathrooms that align with their gender identities.</li>\n<li>Court challenges to the bans have been brought in several states; many of the challenges, like the one in Kentucky, are still in litigation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\".It was as if a guard blocked the door to a room, preventing anyone from entering until the case was settled in court.\"</p>\n<p>Transgender, Medical Care, Kentucky, Puberty Blockers, Hormone Therapy</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/us/kentucky-transgender-ban-blocked.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/us/kentucky-transgender-ban-blocked.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/victory-for-transgender-rights-judge-blocks-ky-law","title":"Victory for Transgender Rights: Judge Blocks KY Law","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"97c104a2-f561-59ad-8965-fe5ea6aaf61f","frontmatter__slug":"/victory-for-transgender-rights-judge-blocks-ky-law","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"victory-for-transgender-rights-judge-blocks-ky-law"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
