After months of intense searches, hikers found human remains in the area on Saturday, which were positively identified as those of Mr. Sands. He was best known for his role in the 1986 film “A Room With a View” and had appeared in dozens of other films and television shows.Search crews had been combing the area for Mr. Sands for months, despite their efforts being complicated by dangerous conditions, including heavy rain and snow. More than 80 search-and-rescue volunteers, deputies and staff members participated in the search, and two helicopters and drone crews were used to check areas inaccessible to searchers on the ground.Mr. Sands often spoke of his fondness for nature and said in interviews that he was happiest when close to a mountain summit on a cold morning. He described mountain climbing as not being about ego, but rather about “supplication and sacrifice and humility” and “the eradication of one’s self-consciousness.” His death is a tragic reminder of the dangers of hiking alone in the wilderness.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>British actor Julian Sands was reported missing in January after he went hiking alone on a trail on Mount Baldy.</li>\n<li>Hikers found human remains in the area on Saturday and they have been positively identified as those of Mr. Sands.</li>\n<li>Mr. Sands was best known for his role in the critically acclaimed 1986 film “A Room With a View”.</li>\n<li>Search crews had been combing the area looking for Mr. Sands for months despite their efforts being complicated by dangerous conditions, including heavy rain and snow.</li>\n<li>Mr. Sands often spoke of his fondness for nature and said in a 2020 interview with The Guardian that he was happiest when close to a mountain summit</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\".It was as if Julian Sands had been a butterfly, drawn to the beauty of the mountain summit, only to be caught in a violent storm, never to be seen again.\"</p>\n<p>Julian Sands, Mount Baldy, Hiking, California, Wilderness,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/julian-sands-hiking-remains-identified.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/julian-sands-hiking-remains-identified.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/-he-is-a-graduate-of-howard-university-julian-sands-remains-found-in-ca-wilderness","title":" He is a graduate of Howard University.
