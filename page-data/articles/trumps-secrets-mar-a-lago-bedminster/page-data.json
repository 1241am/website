However, his 520-acre golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey has also been a crucial part of the case. Investigators have subpoenaed surveillance footage from Bedminster, and there were discussions of executing a search warrant at the property. Bedminster was also the scene of a meeting in which Trump showed off a \"highly confidential\" plan to attack Iran, which was recorded and later published by CNN and The New York Times.The Justice Department lacked probable cause to obtain a warrant from a judge, but investigators were concerned that more documents were stashed at the club and the only way to account for them was to search the property. Bedminster has been a summer getaway for Trump since 2002, and it was mentioned in the indictment filed by the special counsel Jack Smith. Prosecutors said that boxes from Mar-a-Lago were loaded onto a plane that flew Trump and his family north for the summer on the same day that Mr. Bratt showed up in Florida to collect all of the classified documents remaining there.The recording of Trump was made at Bedminster in July 2021 during a meeting attended by two of his aides, a publisher, and a writer. On the recording, Trump can be heard rustling through papers and describing a \"secret\" plan regarding Iran that he said had been drawn up by General Mark A. Milley. This recording is the latest piece of evidence placing Bedminster on an almost equal footing with Mar-a-Lago as a key location in the case being pursued against Mr. Trump.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Former President Donald Trump spent his summers at his 520-acre golf club in Bedminster, N.J.</li>\n<li>Federal agents descended on Mar-a-Lago and hauled away a trove of more than 100 classified documents.</li>\n<li>Investigators have subpoenaed surveillance footage from Bedminster, much like they did from Mar-a-Lago.</li>\n<li>Prosecutors discussed executing a search warrant at Bedminster due to concerns that more documents were stashed there.</li>\n<li>A recording was made at Bedminster in July 2021 during a meeting attended by two of Mr. Trump's aides and a publisher and writer working on a memoir for Mark Meadows.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It was like a game of hide-and-seek, with federal agents searching for documents in Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster, subpoenaing surveillance footage, and executing search warrants to uncover any hidden evidence.\"</p>\n<p>Mar-a-Lago, Bedminster, Investigation, Classified, Trump</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/politics/trump-investigation-bedminster.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/politics/trump-investigation-bedminster.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/trumps-secrets-mar-a-lago--bedminster","title":"Trump's Secrets: Mar-a-Lago & Bedminster"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ec2d46dd-d31a-547e-9130-7da0e965a7ba","frontmatter__slug":"/trumps-secrets-mar-a-lago--bedminster","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"trumps-secrets-mar-a-lago-bedminster"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
