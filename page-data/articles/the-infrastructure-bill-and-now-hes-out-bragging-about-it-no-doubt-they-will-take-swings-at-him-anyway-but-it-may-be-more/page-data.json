These bills have been praised by both Republican and Democratic politicians, including Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, and Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana. Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, who had previously opposed the infrastructure bill, also praised it, saying it was \"great to see Alabama receive crucial funds.\" This has made it difficult for Republicans to criticize the president's economic stewardship, as they have taken credit for the same achievements. The White House is using this to brand Biden as a cross-aisle deal maker, and to appeal to political moderates who formed a core of his winning electoral coalition.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>President Biden is using his bipartisan legislative accomplishments to appeal to political moderates and impress upon tuned-out voters.</li>\n<li>Republicans who helped pass the infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing bills are now promoting them to their constituents.</li>\n<li>19 Republican senators and 13 Republican House members voted for the infrastructure bill.</li>\n<li>16 Senate Republicans and 24 Republicans in the House voted for the semiconductor legislation.</li>\n<li>Republicans are taking credit for the same achievements as President Biden, making it difficult for them to criticize him.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"President Biden is the chef creating a delicious meal, while the Republicans are the servers, delivering the meal to their constituents and taking credit for the same accomplishment.\"</p>\n<p>the infrastructure bill.
