Kennedy Jr. is running a long-shot challenge to President Biden for the Democratic nomination for president in 2024. His campaign is centered around the idea of censorship, which has united an unlikely coalition of longtime acolytes in the “health freedom” movement, donors from Silicon Valley, and new admirers from across the political spectrum. Kennedy has twisted facts about vaccine development and promoted conspiracy theories, which has drawn support from those who distrust authority and are looking for an alternative to Donald J. Trump. He has raised “less than $4 million” since he entered the race in April, and his recent public appearances have been before conservative or libertarian audiences. His campaign is an example of how conspiracy theories and distrust of authority can be used to gain political support.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Robert F.
