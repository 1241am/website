Formed in 1953, the Osborne Brothers band habitually flouted bluegrass convention during its first two decades. They incorporated drums, electric bass, pedal steel guitar and string sections, as well as twin banjos and electric pickups. They also embraced country, pop and rock material, and created a three-part vocal harmonies that became their trademark. They were vindicated for breaking with tradition, and were named vocal group of the year by the Country Music Association in 1971. They also placed records on the country singles chart, and their best known single was “Rocky Top”, which reached the country Top 40 in 1967.The Osbornes’ approach was unorthodox and they caught lots of flack from die-hard bluegrass fans. However, they built a bridge between first-generation bluegrass royalty and intrepid latter-day inheritors. Bobby Osborne passed away in 2021, but his legacy lives on in the music he and his brother created. They created a unique sound that was a combination of bluegrass, country, pop and rock, and their three-part vocal harmonies were revolutionary. They were pioneers in the bluegrass genre and their influence can still be heard today.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bobby Osborne, singer and mandolin player, passed away in 2021 at the age of 91.</li>\n<li>The Osborne Brothers band was formed in 1953 and was one of the most groundbreaking bands in the history of bluegrass.</li>\n<li>The band incorporated drums, electric bass, pedal steel guitar, and even string sections in their music, which was unusual for bluegrass bands at the time.</li>\n<li>The Osbornes also developed a three-part vocal harmony that became their trademark.</li>\n<li>The Osbornes were vindicated for their unorthodox approach and were named vocal group of the year by the Country Music Association in 1971.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"The Osborne Brothers were like an electric storm in a sea of traditional bluegrass, bringing thunderous drums, electric bass, and pedal steel guitar to the genre.
