Hellerstein has indicated that he is likely to deny a request from lawyers for Donald J. Trump to move a New York State criminal case against the former president to federal court. The case stems from a hush-money payment made on Mr. Trump's behalf by his former fixer, Michael D. Cohen, to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels about a tryst she said she had with Mr. Trump. Trump's lawyers argued that the payment was related to constitutional duties, but Judge Hellerstein disagreed. He said that the payment was a \"private matter to take care of private matters.\"The hearing also included a witness called by Trump's lawyers to testify about Cohen's role when he worked as a personal lawyer to Mr. Trump. The witness, Alan Garten, the chief legal officer of the Trump Organization, was then cross-examined by the head of investigations at the district attorney’s office. The prosecutor tried to show that the arrangement with Mr. Cohen was atypical, to which Garten acknowledged but said that such arrangements did happen “from time to time.”Judge Hellerstein said that he would issue a written ruling within two weeks, but was inclined not to transfer the case. If he rules as he suggested he would, the case would proceed as expected in state court, where a trial has been scheduled for March 25.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Judge Alvin K.
