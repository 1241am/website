This was a workaround for shoppers who had not paid for an annual membership, but could borrow a member's card or QR code from the Costco app to avoid the identification requirements of the regular checkout lanes. The company said that it had noticed that nonmember shoppers had been using other people’s membership cards, which are nontransferable, in the self-checkout lanes.
