He was masterful, needing only 99 pitches to retire all 27 batters he faced without allowing a single baserunner. After the game, Germán dedicated the performance to an uncle who had recently passed away. Germán's perfect game was the fourth in Yankees history, joining Don Larsen's in the 1956 World Series, David Wells' in 1998 and David Cone's in 1999. It was also the second Yankees no-hitter in the past three seasons, following a 2021 performance by Corey Kluber against the Texas Rangers. Germán's curveball was the key to his success, as he used it to record 20 of his 27 outs. This was the highest point of an otherwise uneven season for Germán, who had been suspended for 10 games in mid-May for violating league rules against the use of foreign substances on the ball. With Germán's perfect game, the Yankees are now responsible for four of the 24 perfect games in Major League Baseball history.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Domingo Germán of the Yankees threw the 24th perfect game in Major League Baseball history on June 29, 2023.</li>\n<li>Germán needed only 99 pitches to complete the perfect game against the Oakland Athletics.</li>\n<li>The Yankees have thrown four perfect games in their history, the most recent being Germán's.</li>\n<li>Germán dedicated the performance to an uncle who recently passed away.</li>\n<li>Conventional baseball superstition demands that the pitcher throwing the gem not be disturbed, but Germán's pitching coach Matt Blake sat beside him and chatted.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"Domingo Germán's perfect game was like a beautiful painting, carefully crafted with only 99 strokes of the brush.
