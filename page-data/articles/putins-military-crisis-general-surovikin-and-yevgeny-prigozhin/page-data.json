They are trying to determine if General Sergei Surovikin, the former top Russian commander in Ukraine, aided Prigozhin's plans to rebel against Russia's military leadership. American officials are also looking into whether other Russian generals supported Prigozhin's attempt to change the leadership of the Defense Ministry by force.President Vladimir V. Putin must now decide if General Surovikin helped Prigozhin and how he should respond. On Tuesday, the Russian domestic intelligence agency said that it was dropping criminal charges against Prigozhin and members of his force. If Putin finds evidence that Surovikin more directly helped Prigozhin, he will likely have to remove him from his command.U.S. officials have an interest in pushing out information that undermines the standing of General Surovikin, as his removal would benefit Ukraine. American officials have avoided discussing the rebellion publicly, out of fear of feeding Putin's narrative that the unrest was orchestrated by the West.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Yevgeny Prigozhin is the head of Wagner, a private mercenary group.</li>\n<li>U.S. officials are trying to determine if General Sergei Surovikin aided Prigozhin's plans to rebel against Russia's military leadership.</li>\n<li>There are signs that other Russian generals may have supported Prigozhin's attempt to change the leadership of the Defense Ministry.</li>\n<li>President Vladimir Putin must decide if General Surovikin helped Prigozhin and how he should respond.</li>\n<li>U.S. officials have an interest in pushing out information that undermines the standing of General Surovikin, as his removal would benefit Ukraine.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It's like a game of chess: U.S. officials are trying to capture General Surovikin, while President Putin must decide if General Surovikin is part of Yevgeny Prigozhin's plans to rebel against Russia's military leadership.
