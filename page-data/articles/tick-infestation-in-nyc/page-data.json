These new ticks, such as the Asian longhorned tick, are not deterred by mowed grass or direct sunlight and can reproduce asexually. The rise of these new species is attributed to the bumper crop of acorns in 2021, which provided a feast for white-footed mice and chipmunks, allowing more ticks to survive. The arrival of the Gulf Coast tick, which carries a mild form of spotted fever, is also concerning. While no cases have been reported yet, experts expect this to change in the future.
