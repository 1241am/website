It looks at the policies and guidance from state and local leaders, as well as the behavior of citizens. The author argues that, contrary to popular belief, the pandemic response was not highly polarized along party lines. In fact, the policies and guidance from state and local leaders were quite similar, regardless of the party in power. The biggest differences were in the rhetoric used by leaders, and in the actual in-person schooling offered in different states. Even the issue of mask-wearing showed only a small partisan gap. The author also looks at the impact of the presidential election and the rollout of the vaccine on the level of polarization. Vaccine mandates created a partisan wedge, with Democrats more likely to get vaccinated than Republicans. This text shows that, while the pandemic response was not completely apolitical, it was not as polarized as many believe.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The United States did not have to collapse into Covid partisanship when the pandemic arrived, with citizens turning against each other and each party vilifying the other.</li>\n<li>The differences between the stay-at-home orders issued by Democratic and Republican governors were small.</li>\n<li>The Oxford researchers found that the differences in business, social distancing, and masking policies between states did not map neatly onto partisanship.</li>\n<li>By September 2020, all states had some form of masking policy or recommendation in place.</li>\n<li>Vaccination has become a source of Covid polarization, with Democrats more likely to get vaccinated than Republicans.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It was like a river that could have been crossed with a few stones, but instead two sides built walls and began throwing stones at each other, until eventually the river was filled and the walls were too high to climb.\"</p>\n<p>Pandemic, Lockdown, Social Distancing, Masking, School Closings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/opinion/covid-pandemic-2020-or-covid-pandemic-politics.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/opinion/covid-pandemic-2020-or-covid-pandemic-politics.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/uniting-to-fight-covid-a-tale-of-unexpected-unity","title":"Uniting to Fight Covid: A Tale of Unexpected Unity","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"30ca83e9-bb2e-5b91-849d-e639de8e5ede","frontmatter__slug":"/uniting-to-fight-covid-a-tale-of-unexpected-unity","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"uniting-to-fight-covid-a-tale-of-unexpected-unity"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
