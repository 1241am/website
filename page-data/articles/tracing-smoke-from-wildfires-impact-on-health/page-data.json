The findings could help officials to determine which wildfires are likely to have the biggest health consequences for the greatest number of people, and to allocate firefighting resources accordingly. The study shows that as fires have worsened, so has their smoke, with the U.S. population experiencing double the smoke pollution from 2016 to 2020 compared to 2006 to 2010. The researchers ranked all of the wildfires observed in the United States from April 2006 to December 2020 by the resulting smoke exposure and found that the worst fire by smoke exposure during this period was the 2007 Bugaboo Fire. This was because the Eastern Seaboard is more densely populated, so smoke from the Bugaboo Fire didnâ€™t have to go far to affect many millions of people. The study also found that the worst fires in their ranking did not match up very well with the worst fires in traditional rankings, such as acres burned or buildings and infrastructure lost.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Researchers at Stanford University have developed a new way to trace smoke and pollution from wildfires back to their origin.</li>\n<li>The chemical composition of smoke can change with time and distance as it travels.</li>\n<li>The study found that smoke pollution in the US has doubled from 2006-2010 to 2016-2020.</li>\n<li>The worst fire by smoke exposure from 2006-2020 was the 2007 Bugaboo Fire in the Okefenokee Swamp.</li>\n<li>Firefighting resources are not always allocated to the fires that are most damaging from a health perspective.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It's like trying to trace the source of a river by studying its current composition, but with the added challenge of it doubling in size and the worst effects not always being addressed.\"</p>\n<p>Wildfire, Smoke, Pollution, Health, Tracking</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/climate/tracing-wildfire-smoke-health.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/climate/tracing-wildfire-smoke-health.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/tracing-smoke-from-wildfires-impact-on-health","title":"Tracing Smoke from Wildfires: Impact on Health","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"993b46a8-2e14-5dbc-b30b-f73e9de79813","frontmatter__slug":"/tracing-smoke-from-wildfires-impact-on-health","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"tracing-smoke-from-wildfires-impact-on-health"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
