This doctrine was based on the argument that the Constitution grants state legislatures broad, independent powers to regulate elections for president and for Congress. The case, Moore v. Harper, turned on a complicated North Carolina redistricting dispute. After SCOTUS took the case, the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed itself and held that partisan gerrymanders weren't \"justiciable\" under state law. In a 6-to-3 vote, the Supreme Court not only declined to dismiss the case; it also flatly rejected the independent state legislature doctrine.The Republican effort to overturn the 2020 election was based on two key arguments: a conspiracy theory and a coup theory. The conspiracy theory was that the election was fundamentally flawed, while the coup theory was that the Constitution provided a remedy that would enable Donald Trump to remain in office. The Supreme Court's decision in Moore v. Harper dealt a blow to both of these arguments, reaffirming the soundness of the 2020 election and securing the integrity of elections to come.The Supreme Court's decision in Moore v. Harper is a major victory for American democracy. It is a clear rejection of the Republican effort to overturn the 2020 election and a reaffirmation of the Constitution's provisions for state legislatures to regulate elections. This decision will have a lasting impact on the integrity of future elections and will help ensure that the will of the people is respected.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Republican effort to overturn the 2020 election had two aspects: a conspiracy theory and a coup theory.</li>\n<li>The Supreme Court rejected the “independent state legislature” doctrine in the case Moore v.
