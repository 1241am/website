The Air Quality Index reached 209 by noon, the worst reading of any major city in the world for the day, according to IQAir. Mayor Brandon Johnson warned residents to stay indoors or wear masks if they had to be outside. Similar levels of smoke were expected in other cities in the region, including Milwaukee, and officials in New York warned that smoky skies may return to their state on Wednesday. Many people in Chicago seemed caught off guard by the sudden influx of smoke, since the city is rarely affected by air pollution from wildfires. Summer camps scrambled to make new plans for children, keeping them indoors and away from the polluted air. The state veterinarianâ€™s office in Michigan issued an alert to people who own animals, reminding the owners that strenuous activities should be avoided. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued its 23rd air quality alert of the year, a record high, as a layer of smoke hovered over much of the state. The smoky air from Canadian wildfires has had a significant impact on the Upper Midwest, leading to air quality warnings and forcing people to stay indoors or wear masks when they venture outside. The haze is expected to linger on Wednesday, and officials are warning people to take precautions to protect their health.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Smoky air from Canadian wildfires blanketed Chicago and much of the Upper Midwest on Tuesday.</li>\n<li>Chicago's Air Quality Index reached 209 by noon, the worst reading of any major city in the world for the day.</li>\n<li>Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago warned residents to stay indoors or wear masks if they had to be outside.</li>\n<li>Air quality alerts were issued in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, and Minnesota.</li>\n<li>The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued its 23rd air quality alert of the year, a record high.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"The smoky air from Canadian wildfires was like a thick, dark blanket that slowly descended upon Chicago and the Upper Midwest, leaving the air quality so poor that Mayor Johnson had to issue warnings and alerts were sent out across five states, with Minnesota setting a record high.\"</p>\n<p>Smoky, Air, Canadian, Wildfires, Midwestern, Chicago, Haze, Unhealthy, Air Quality, Warnings, Respiratory, Climate Crisis, Visibility, Pollution, Animals, Minnesota, Alert.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/midwest-chicago-smoke-air-quality.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/midwest-chicago-smoke-air-quality.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/smoky-skies-blanket-midwest-from-canadian-wildfires","title":"Smoky Skies Blanket Midwest from Canadian Wildfires"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"638a76fb-9d6f-593a-a7cd-76b7a07d3892","frontmatter__slug":"/smoky-skies-blanket-midwest-from-canadian-wildfires","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"smoky-skies-blanket-midwest-from-canadian-wildfires"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
