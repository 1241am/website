His ability to win the White House and retain the loyalty of so many voters despite being exposed as a liar has been a challenge to the American political system. A 2017 Scientific American article argued that this phenomenon can be explained by the concept of \"blue lies\", which are lies told in the name of the collective good. This idea suggests that people are prone to divide themselves into competitive groups, and that Trump's lies are seen as a weapon of war by his supporters. Additionally, a March 10 paper by political scientists at Aarhus University in Denmark posed the question of how powerful orthodox mindsets emerge, and how they restrict free thinking. These two approaches provide insight into why Trump's lies have been tolerated by so many Republican and conservative voters.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Donald Trump is considered the most prodigious liar in the history of the presidency.</li>\n<li>The concept of \"blue lies\" has been explored as a possible explanation for the loyalty of Republican and conservative voters to Trump despite his lies.</li>\n<li>Blue lies are lies told in the name of the collective good.</li>\n<li>Antoine Marie and Michael Bang Petersen have posed the question of how powerful orthodox mind-sets emerge that restrict free thinking.</li>\n<li>The paper \"The Cognitive Foundations of Ideological Orthodoxy: Threat Avoidance, Ingroup Mobilization and Signaling\" explores this question.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"Donald Trump is like a powerful storm, creating a false sense of security and loyalty that restricts free thinking, just like the blue lies explored by Antoine Marie and Michael Bang Petersen in their paper \"The Cognitive Foundations of Ideological Orthodoxy: Threat Avoidance, Ingroup Mobilization and\"</p>\n<p>Lies, Trump, Politics, Deception, Blue Lie</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/opinion/donald-trump-presidency-lies.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/opinion/donald-trump-presidency-lies.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/trumps-lies-examining-the-blue-lie-phenomenon","title":"Trump's Lies: Examining the Blue Lie Phenomenon","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e9eb73f5-1acb-5225-ac89-fc54df30620f","frontmatter__slug":"/trumps-lies-examining-the-blue-lie-phenomenon","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"trumps-lies-examining-the-blue-lie-phenomenon"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
