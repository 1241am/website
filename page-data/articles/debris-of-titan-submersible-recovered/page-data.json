After an international search-and-rescue effort, the vessel was presumed lost and its passengers dead. On Wednesday, debris from the Titan was returned to land off Newfoundland, including the 22-foot hull, crinkled and twisted with exposed wires and cables. The debris will be taken to a U.S. port for further analysis and testing, and medical professionals will conduct a formal analysis of any presumed human remains. The U.S. Coast Guard is leading the investigation into why the submersible imploded and has convened a marine board of investigation. It is working with other national and international agencies and the investigation could take 18 to 24 months. The recovered debris could contain vital information about what happened to the Titan and investigators will be looking for a point of failure of the hull, how pieces of carbon fiber and titanium were connected, and if any electronic data is recoverable.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Debris and presumed human remains from the Titan submersible have been recovered and returned to land.</li>\n<li>The debris will be taken to a U.S. port for further analysis and testing.</li>\n<li>The investigation into why the submersible imploded is being led by the U.S. Coast Guard.</li>\n<li>The investigation could take anywhere from 18 to 24 months.</li>\n<li>The Titan lost communications two hours into the dive to the Titanic's remains.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"It's like finding a crashed plane: the wreckage and presumed human remains have been retrieved and taken to a port for further investigation.
