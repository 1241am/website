The appearance was especially noteworthy due to the fact that the Justice Department had just reached a plea agreement with Hunter two days prior, which will likely avoid him prison time. Despite the potential optics issues, the White House said that Hunter was simply being a father.The visuals of Hunter Biden at the White House have highlighted the difficult situation for the President, as he must balance his love and support for his son with the attacks from the hard right. Democrats have criticized the conspiratorial fixation on Hunter's troubles, while some of the President's allies have privately complained that he has not stepped in more assertively to stop Hunter from trading on the family name. However, many Americans understand a father's love for his son, and it is not expected to hurt the President's re-election bid.The plea deal last week was a difficult situation for many reasons, as it meant that the President had to confront the legal issues of his son. However, the President's appearances with Hunter show that he is determined to stand by his son, and that he loves and supports him despite his mistakes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hunter Biden was present at the White House state dinner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.</li>\n<li>Hunter Biden's presence at the White House state dinner was seen as a message of defiance by President Biden.</li>\n<li>Hunter Biden was also seen on Marine One with President Biden heading to and from Camp David.</li>\n<li>Democrats, including current and former Biden administration officials, saw Hunter Biden's presence as an unnecessary gesture.</li>\n<li>President Biden's allies privately complain that he has a blind eye when it comes to his son's business dealings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"Hunter Biden was the guest of honor at the White House state dinner, like a proud parent proudly displaying their child's accomplishments, despite the criticism of their peers.\"</p>\n<p>Hunter Biden, White House, Prime Minister, Merrick Garland, Justice Department, Marine One, Camp David, Defiance, Father's Love, Blind Eye, Election, Target, Plea Deal</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/politics/hunter-biden-democrats.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/politics/hunter-biden-democrats.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/biden-stands-by-son-defiant-white-house-message","title":"Biden Stands by Son: Defiant White House Message"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8641e209-8179-58df-b6f8-5384f387a367","frontmatter__slug":"/biden-stands-by-son-defiant-white-house-message","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"biden-stands-by-son-defiant-white-house-message"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
