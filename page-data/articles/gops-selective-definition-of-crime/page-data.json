Republicans now believe that federal crimes are not real crimes, and that state and local crimes are only a problem in urban areas or states run by Democrats. They also believe that Hunter Biden's tax crimes are not real crimes, but rather proof of a sweetheart deal.Republicans have accused the Department of Justice of being a Democratic Party strike force, and the FBI of being corrupted by political forces. They have also fought to reduce the number of IRS investigators who fight against tax fraud.Republicans have also claimed that crime is worse in cities run by Democrats, even though the crime rate has gone up in many cities during the pandemic, and remains lower than its peak in the 1990s. They have also tried to remove local prosecutors who they believe are not doing enough to fight crime. However, some of these moves are entirely political. Republicans have yet to find any evidence of the influence peddling they believe Hunter Biden and President Biden have engaged in, but Hunter Biden will plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failing to pay taxes on time.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Republicans have a selective definition of what constitutes a crime.</li>\n<li>Federal crimes are no longer trusted by Republicans.</li>\n<li>Republicans are more likely to focus on state and local crimes in urban areas or states run by Democrats.</li>\n<li>Republicans do not focus on state and local crimes in rural areas or states run by Republicans.</li>\n<li>Republicans are pursuing a fantasy that Hunter Biden and President Biden engaged in influence peddling, despite no evidence, while Hunter Biden will plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failing to pay taxes on time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"Republicans are like a person in a candy store, selectively picking out only certain types of candy, while ignoring the others, and then claiming the ones they chose are the only ones worth eating.\"</p>\n<p>, @GeorgeWylesol, Law-and-Order, Federal Crimes, State Crimes, Hunter Biden, Tax Crimes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/opinion/republicans-crime-guide.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/opinion/republicans-crime-guide.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/-gops-selective-definition-of-crime","title":": GOP's Selective Definition of Crime"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"051ee0ed-c591-5112-ba9e-2d8b2f86b04c","frontmatter__slug":"/-gops-selective-definition-of-crime","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"gops-selective-definition-of-crime"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
