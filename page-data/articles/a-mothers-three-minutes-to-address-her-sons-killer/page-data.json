She was struggling to write a statement about her son for the court hearing, and was unsure what to say. Every day, victims of violence stand up in court to express their anguish and loss, and the latest era of mass shootings has brought new resonance to this ritual of the American justice system. The survivors and victims' families each had three minutes to face the shooter, and the question of whether to speak and what to say can be particularly fraught.Sabrina Aston and her husband Jeff, the parents of another victim, wrote down a few thoughts as they flew home from Pride celebrations in Tulsa. They decided to address the shooter in court, and Mr. Aston talked about his son’s easy laughter and “burning blue eyes”. Ms. Aston told the killer that their actions were “brutal, hate-filled and cowardly” and said she did not believe they were remorseful.Adriana Vance also spoke in court, though she discarded the words she had written, as they were not good words. She wanted to say how sweet and easygoing her son had been, and how his friends had not wanted to let go of his coffin at the funeral. The courtroom was filled with reporters and cameras, and victims say they feel the burden of speaking not just for themselves and the memory of their loved ones, but also for others whose lives have been torn apart by mass shootings.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Adriana Vance lost her son Raymond in a mass shooting seven months ago.</li>\n<li>Victim impact statements are meant to give grieving families and survivors their moment in court before sentencing.</li>\n<li>Most mass shooters do not live to see a trial, so there is often no such moment after their attacks.</li>\n<li>Families of victims of mass shootings struggle to find the right words to express their anguish and loss in court.</li>\n<li>Victims of mass shootings often feel the burden of speaking not just for themselves and the memory of their loved ones, but also for others whose lives have been torn apart by mass shootings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"Adriana Vance is like a lighthouse in a storm, shining a light of hope and justice for her son Raymond and all the other victims of mass shootings, despite the darkness that surrounds them.\"</p>\n<p>Grief, Loss, Justice, Forgiveness, Memory</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/mass-shootings-victim-impact-statements.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/mass-shootings-victim-impact-statements.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/a-mothers-three-minutes-to-address-her-sons-killer","title":"A Mother's Three Minutes to Address Her Son's Killer"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"aa1d1ca0-2530-5df5-b840-c8ff6d531a9a","frontmatter__slug":"/a-mothers-three-minutes-to-address-her-sons-killer","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"a-mothers-three-minutes-to-address-her-sons-killer"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
