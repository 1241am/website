Residents have been fighting to keep the garden, while the city has been pushing for the development of affordable housing on the site. On Tuesday, the housing plan prevailed when an appellate court cleared the way for a 123-apartment development for lower-income people over the age of 62 and their families. The ruling was a “huge win” for the city’s housing commissioner, who noted that the fight highlights how difficult it can be to build affordable housing in wealthy areas. The garden’s supporters are disappointed with the ruling and are seeking permission to appeal the case to the state’s highest court. They are hoping for a solution that preserves the garden while still providing housing. The project is part of the city’s effort to address its dire housing shortage, and the opposition to it is emblematic of the “not-in-my-backyard” mentality of many higher-income areas. Environmental regulations have also been used to fight the development of new housing. The court’s decision is a step towards providing much needed affordable housing in New York City.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Elizabeth Street Garden in Manhattan is a popular public space and is owned by the city.</li>\n<li>The city wants to build 123 affordable apartments for lower-income people over the age of 62 and their families on the site.</li>\n<li>The fight over the fate of the garden has been ongoing for more than 10 years.</li>\n<li>The city's housing commissioner called the court ruling a \"huge win\" for the affordable housing plan.</li>\n<li>The lawsuit was filed as a challenge under state environmental laws and reflects how environmental regulations are increasingly being used to fight development of new housing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"The city's housing commissioner is like a chef trying to prepare a delicious meal, but the lawsuit filed against them is like a spice that is making the recipe more complex.
