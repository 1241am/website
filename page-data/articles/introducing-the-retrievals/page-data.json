The series examines how the patients’ distinct identities informed the way they made sense of what happened to them in the procedure room, as well as the story of the nurse who was stealing fentanyl and replacing it with saline. The series also explores the stories we tell about women’s pain, and how it is tolerated, interpreted and accounted for. The music for the series was composed by Carla Pallone, and the sound design and music supervision was done by Phoebe Wang.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Retrievals is a five-part narrative series from Serial Productions and The New York Times about a fertility clinic at Yale.</li>\n<li>The series explores the shocking events that unfolded at the clinic, including a nurse stealing fentanyl and replacing it with saline.</li>\n<li>The series examines how the patients’ distinct identities informed the way they made sense of what happened to them in the procedure room.</li>\n<li>The series is hosted by Susan Burton, a veteran staff member at “This American Life” and author of the memoir “Empty.”</li>\n<li>The series explores the stories we tell about women’s pain and how it is tolerated, interpreted, and accounted for.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"The Retrievals is like a magnifying glass, carefully examining the stories of the patients at the Yale fertility clinic and uncovering the truth of the shocking events that unfolded, hosted by Susan Burton, an experienced guide.\"</p>\n<p>Podcasts, Fertility, Pain, Women, Yale</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/podcasts/serial-the-retrievals-yale-fertility-clinic.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/podcasts/serial-the-retrievals-yale-fertility-clinic.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/introducing-the-retrievals","title":"Introducing: The Retrievals","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"57ac96fd-4a4b-51cf-a6bf-c442e375e0de","frontmatter__slug":"/introducing-the-retrievals","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"introducing-the-retrievals"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
