It is a lifeline for the Indigenous people living there, providing transportation to medical specialists, a floating supermarket, and a place to buy a cold beer. It has also attracted a diverse range of people from all over the world, including Mormon missionaries, Mennonite farmers, Indigenous chiefs, Japanese chefs, and more. However, the Aquidaban's future is uncertain as new roads have been built across Paraguay, cutting into the ferry's cargo sales and making it difficult for the Desvars family to afford repairs. This may be the last year of the Aquidaban's journeys, leaving the Indigenous people of the Pantanal without their vital lifeline.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Aquidaban is the only regular ferry service in the Paraguayan Pantanal, a floodplain larger than Greece.</li>\n<li>The Aquidaban has been in operation for 44 years and is used by locals, particularly the Indigenous, to travel more freely through their forest home.</li>\n<li>The Aquidaban is a crucible for the cultural hash that has long been a trademark of Paraguay, attracting a steady parade of zealots, idealists, utopians and outcasts from abroad.</li>\n<li>Paraguay has been carving new roads across its remote north, which has cut into the Aquidabanâ€™s cargo sales and may lead to the boat's demise.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>5</p>\n<p>\".
