It could help officials to determine which wildfires are likely to have the biggest health consequences for the greatest number of people and to allocate firefighting resources accordingly. The study also found that from 2016 to 2020, the U.S. population experienced double the smoke pollution that it did 10 years earlier. The researchers ranked all of the wildfires observed in the United States from April 2006 to December 2020 by the resulting smoke exposure and found that the worst fire by smoke exposure during this period was the 2007 Bugaboo Fire. This was due to the Eastern Seaboard being more densely populated, so smoke from the Bugaboo Fire didnâ€™t have to go far to affect many millions of people. The findings of the study could help to better allocate resources to the fires that will have the biggest health consequences.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An upcoming study from Stanford University offers a new way to trace far-flung smoke and pollution back to individual wildfires of origin.</li>\n<li>The findings could help officials to determine which wildfires are likely to have the biggest health consequences for the greatest number of people, and to allocate firefighting resources accordingly.</li>\n<li>The new study shows that as fires have worsened, so has their smoke: From 2016 to 2020, the U.S. population experienced double the smoke pollution that it did 10 years earlier, from 2006 to 2010.</li>\n<li>The researchers found that the worst fire by smoke exposure during this period was the 2007 Bugaboo Fire, which burned more than 130,000 acres in and around the Okefen</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\"okee Swamp in Georgia.It's like detective work, tracing a criminal's steps to find the source of the crime: the Stanford study is tracking smoke and pollution to pinpoint the origin of wildfires and determine which are most harmful to people.\"</p>\n<p>Wildfire, Smoke, Pollution, Health, Tracking</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/climate/tracing-wildfire-smoke-health.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/climate/tracing-wildfire-smoke-health.html</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 28, 2023","slug":"/tracing-smoke-uncovering-wildfire-health-impacts","title":"Tracing Smoke: Uncovering Wildfire Health Impacts","lang":"en-US"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3f4a52e8-b428-50ec-8fe1-79eaa1d0a8cc","frontmatter__slug":"/tracing-smoke-uncovering-wildfire-health-impacts","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"tracing-smoke-uncovering-wildfire-health-impacts"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
